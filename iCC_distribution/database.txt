charles,hall,charleswigginshall@gmail.com,Hello-

My name is Charles Hall, I am in the first stages of developing a vertical publisher online media display advertising program for a DC-based, e-commerce site dedicated to luxury/best brand apparel for sports and adventure enthusiasts. One of the titles we are interested in exploring is The Drake Magazine. 

Some basic client demographic info:
- Adults (52% M/ 48% Female)
- Median Age:  44
- Median Income:  $145,362
- Top Mgmt.  18%
- Prof/Managerial:  50%
- A County:  51%

At this stage what I need to compile are site traffic info, user site demographics (HHI, M/F) and non-negotiated display cpm rates so that we can plan for campaign launch, optimization and rollout efforts. 

Launch would be June/July, rollout is Aug/Sept/Oct and holiday period is Nov/Dec/Jan.

Please let me know if you need any additional information. Look forward to speaking with the appropriate contact person soon.

best,

cwh

A few friends in the industry mentioned that you'd be a good place to start to get my name out there.  I wanted to see what your rates & options are so I don't have to give ALL my money to Google....

Been living & working in Costa Rica for 9 years in the sport fishing industry, I just started my own travel agency on Jan 1st, 2014.  We offer fishing vacations (conventional & fly) all over Costa Rica, Panama, and Belize.  So far so good, but more is always better.

Tom ,Brodhead,tabrods@charter.net,Hi Tom,

I am working starting a business that sells fly lines aimed at the fiberglass fly rod owner. I'm recreating some of the old tapers used when glass was the dominant force in the market and updating them with newer materials. They will be American made and priced lower than current ridiculous prices for plastic coated string. I'm looking at mostly web advertising so if you could send me prices to advertise on the website it would be appreciated. Just for the fun of it what would ads run for the mag?

Thanks,

Eric,Kleinschmidt,bugtyer@gmail.com,Hello Drake CS Dept!

I just received the new Winter 2012/2013 issue in the mail, and there is a problem with the pages.  Appears that the pages 65-75ish are folded over in the printing run, though they are there following the folded pages, they are bound together.  Just wanted to let you know in case anyone else has the same problem with their edition.

Keep up the awesome work!

Steve,Bridges,stephen@webenhancement.com,Drake Magazine,

I read your magazine and I love it. It's a great publication.

Anyways, I have an idea that we might be able to help each other with. I am in the process of trying to become a guide and I feel like I could set myself apart by going to guide school and honing my skills. In order to make this possible I have launched a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo. 

You can see the link here http://www.indiegogo.com/steveyourfutureflyfishingguide/x/1852149

Anyways, I was wondering if you could help me out by sharing the link and possibly featuring it on your site or in your magazine.

In return I could write articles for The Drake about becoming a guide and the process and my thoughts on it.

I am looking at attending Sweetwater Guide School and could write about the process leading up to it as well as what it is like after I attend, if I raise enough money to go.

I feel like I could provide a unique perspective of a trout bum trying to survive in the academic world or vice versa.

I am an active blogger. You can check out my blog wetaddiction.com. Please let me know either way.

Thank you for your time,

Diana J.,Diana J. Blevins,top1freeseomkt@gmail.com,Drakemag.com Team,

I thought you might like to know some of the reasons why you are not getting enough Social Media and Organic search engine traffic for Drakemag.com

1.Your website Drakemag.com is not ranking top in Google organic search for many competitive keyword phrases.

2. Your website profile is not available in most of the Social Media Websites.

3. Your site has 60 Google back links, this can be improved further.

There are many additional improvements that could be made to your website, and if you would like to learn about them, and are curious to know what our working together would involve, then I would be glad to provide you with a detailed analysis in the form of a WEBSITE AUDIT REPORT for FREE.

Our clients consistently tell us that their customers find them because they are at the top of the Google search rankings.  Being at the top left of Google (#1- #3 organic positions) is the best thing you can do for your company's website traffic and online reputation.

I found your site in the Google search and after having a look over your website I think you should go for an SEO campaign to boost your marketing strategy.

Sounds interesting? Feel free to email us or alternatively you can provide me with your phone number and the best time to call you.

Barny,Wong,sushiyummy@yahoo.com,Hi Tom or Geoff. I know Geoff from the days he was the editor at FFM, where he bought my article 'Tailing Loops' in Jan 2009 (published Jan 2013 edition). I was wondering if you would consider Drake expanding its content to cover Fly casting. I understand the poetic, jocular, no BS, and lyrical qualities that is the brand for the magazine. Good job. The reason I bring this up is I feel the other magazines have a vanilla or McD's approach to the experience. What I try to reveal in my writing is the better we are observers (of the rod, and finally of ourselves), the more we get out of it. I feel Drake can be a place of uncommon wisdom, experience, angular, fresh, and also revelatory in the whole FF experience that does not feel tired or recycled. Let me know if Drake can consider this proposal, article titled 'The Haul'.,,2013-01-30 16:00:52

Nicholas,Swingle,nick@twofistedheartproductions.com,To whom it may concern,

We are requesting Drake sponsorship for one or more fly fishing films this year. We have three films in pre-production, but there's one in particular I think you may be interested in. This summer/fall we're doing a piece on sight-fishing for redfish and speckled trout in the flats of Galveston Bay just outside of Houston.  This is adrenaline pumping sight-fishing in the heart of Big Oil and the urban setting of the greater Houston metro area. Currently we plan on submitting the film to the 2014 F3T, but that may change as we finalize the delivery format and venue.

Please let us know if the Drake would like to be involved.  We are requesting a monetary contribution for the addition of the Drake logo as named sponsor for the film. 

For example our work, please see the trailer for Urban Lines, selected for the 2013 Fly Fishing Film Tour (F3T):
https://vimeo.com/57194663

We look forward to opportunities to work with the Drake on future projects.

     I Have a slight problem with the Post Office here in Avon,Co. Last summer I took a temporary job in Yellowstone (mainly to fish!). I used a temporary change of address form from the Post Office to have my mail sent to me there. From May to Mid-Oct. 2012 I recieved nothing which is to include my Drake magazines!!!! I do not  blame you folks at all, but now I'm back in Avon I got the problem with the Post Office fixed, still no Drake Magazine. I believe I have a two year subscription. Again , this has never been your problem but could you possibly help me from your end??? I got an e-mail last week from Drake informing me of a new issue, of course the Post office hasn't got it!

My wife gave me a subscription for Christmas (awesome!).  She received an email confirmation on Jan 4th ORDER #7279.  I haven't received anything yet, should I have?  I just want to be certain everything's good to go.

Griffin,Bonham,griffin.bonham@gmail.com,I have been planning to renew my subscription which should have ended with the fall issue, but I actually never received the fall issue so it kind of slipped my mind. I think I may have sent my change in address too late. Is there anyway I can renew my subscription to start and receive the winter issue as the first issue? Can you also send a copy of the fall issue to my new address as I never actually received it? 
I love the magazine and it continues to be the only one I always enjoy from cover to cover.
Best,

Tyler,Warren,tw9@live.delhi.edu,As a soon to graduate college student who had already tried out the real world and didn't quite care for it, I truly enjoyed Andrew Bosway's article in the Tippets section of the Winter 2012/2013 Drake. Likely heading towards my own post-college quarter life crisis, I found great humor in reading about someone else's. I also got a good laugh out of the subtle irony of the "Soak it all in, Glenwood Springs, Colorado" ad being right next to this article. Keep on publishing quality like this and I'll keep reading for sure. For now I'll take solace in the fact that I chose a career where I won't have to die 1600 pixels of AutoCAD at at time to get me through my sickness.,,2013-02-17 16:42:13

									February 18, 2013

To Whom It May Concern:

I am the fundraising chairman for the Fort Worth Flyfishers.  We are a 501(c) not-for-profit organization dedicated to the promotion of fly fishing and environmental stewardship through educational programs for both youths and adults.

Our annual fund-raising auction will be held this year on Tuesday April 30, 2013 at University Christian Church in Fort Worth.  We would greatly appreciate any support your company may provide this year in our endeavors.  We are pleased to include donors’ names and contact information in the three club newsletter issues following our auction and post on our club’s links site on the web.  We have managed to secure support in the form of gift subscriptions from other fly-fishing publications, and I hoped that we may be able to gain the support of "The Drake" as well.

Our club auction is our primary fundraiser for the year, and proceeds go toward our club operations, educational programs, and environmental clean-up efforts. Moreover, we give generously to various non-profit organizations like Casting for Recovery, Reel Recovery, and Project Healing Waters.

Please feel free to contact me by phone at 214-405-4129 or by e-mail at ejames@hpb.com if I can provide any further information about our club.  Donations may be mailed to the club address above or to me as provided below.

Please visit our organization’s website at www.fortworthflyfishers.org for more information about the club.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Donna,Lindsay,donna.lindsay777@gmail.com,My husband and son just went to the fly fishing film tour in Bend, Oregon.  I was looking through the Stonefly magazine they were given at the tour and you have an advertisement in there with an x-ray of a skull with a fish inside, "Fish on the Brain."  I have a good way for you to advertise your magazine... make them into large stickers for auto, RV and boats, but have a few different types of fish inside so the fisherman/woman can choose what type of fish is on the brain.  I think they would become very popular stickers like the "Fear no fish" stickers that you see everywhere.  And...if you make them, we're in for a few purchases!  ,541-389-8406,2013-02-20 08:33:58

gilad,greenberg,gowithdaflow69@hotmail.com,Hi, I was wondering if you guys would be able to point me in the right direction as to making a semi professional fly fishing movie.  3 friends and I have put together roughly 15k to do up a fly fishing trip and around northern queensland and would like to make a 5 minute movie about our adventure. How hard is it to just go out and film? I have recently been building various contraptions to help get underwater footage as i feel that this is a major area fly films are lacking.  Do the pros use jib cranes, slider and steady cams and all the other equipment that is used in major productions? Do they setup the shot for hours and then start filming? How do they go about this?

I guess Im kind of asking what do they go through from the time they set out till the time they are editing? Do they all have professional film backgrounds or is it something you can learn on the fly?

Sean,Brown,seanb19@gmail.com,To Whom It May Concern,
Ohio Fly Fishing and Steelhead Alley Angler have joined together to coordinate the first annual OFF/SAA Meet and Greet event.  As the spring steelhead run is quickly approaching, what a better time to rally the troops to kick off the 2013 spring fishing season!  On April 27th anglers will join together for fellowship, fishing, food and fun.  With over 500 active members via Facebook social media and a website presence reaching roughly 2 million viewers per year, this meet and greet will continue to promote  Ohio Fly Fishing and Steelhead Alley Angler’s common vision of fishing and conservation.
Both myself and Ben See are reaching out to those in the fishing industry that provide products and services to the area anglers to see if you may have interest in helping with a donation for our Meet and Greet Event.  It is our goal to give back to those in the steelhead alley fishing communities that are loyal supporters of our vision and mission throughout the season.
No donation is too big or too small, yet in the event your donation would be valued more than $200, we would use it in our silent auction.  All proceeds collected from silent auction would be donated to the Mike Durkalec Healing fund as well as the Cleveland Metro Parks.  A friend to many, Mike Durkalec “Cleveland Metro Parks Aquatic Biologist” was involved in serious car accident this year, and in an effort to help offset the cost of medical care, Team SAA and Ohio Fly Fishing want to come together to help in any way we can.  Your donation would greatly help this effort.
In return for your donation, Ohio Fly Fishing and Steelhead Alley Angler will not only be promoting the event itself, but also acknowledge those who helped sponsor the event with their donations.  Your company name or service would be included on the promotional material for and at the event.  Such as flyers, banners, website, etc…  With both SAA and OFF reaching approximately 2 million viewers a year, it may be a great way to promote your products and services, while also helping us give back to our membership.
If you are interested in donating to the 2013 OFF/SAA Meet and Greet please contact:

Kevin,Platt,rthorup@yahoo.com,My wife ordered a subscription of The Drake for me around the holidays. It was charged to our credit card in January and I still have not received one yet. But I have seen the new issue at the store.
We are very disappointed in your customer service. We have both tried to contact someone by phone with no success.
Please contact us if there is a problem.  We have not had this problem with other quarterly or monthly subscriptions we have previously or currently subscribe to.

Thank You,  Kevin Platt

Gregory ,Adrien,fishfreak34@gmail.com,Good morning. My name Is Sergeant Adrien and I am currently with the 793rd Military Police Battalion, stationed at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska. We recently had an active duty soldier have all his fishing gear stolen from him. A police report was filed and can be presented as proof. This soldier had $1989 worth of gear stolen from him. While upset, the only thing he ever talks about is how whoever took the stuff can keep it, he just wants his fly gear back. Apparently this is some good gear and he loves it. 

My question to you is, if I supplied you guys with a copy of the police report, would you be willing to donate some new gear to help this soldier get back into the sport he loves and continue to catch his Alaskan salmon and trout?

Donald,Jackson,donaldjackson444@gmail.com,Hi drakemag Team,

Greetings !!!

I thought if your website is still not ranked on the top pages of Google SERPs for your popular keywords (Products), you might like to know some of the reasons. Your loss is your competitor’s gain i.e. the traffic which could have generated quality sales for you goes to your competitors as they rank well in the Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs) organically.

Reasons: 

1.    HTML and other on-page errors are present on your website.
2.    Low number of internal and external quality links present on your website.
3.    Need to update fresh contents on your website as per the latest Google guideline.
4.    Social media profile needs to be updated regularly.

If you are getting rigid by paying a huge amount in PPC, then Organic listing by using white hat technique will be definitely a right choice for you. As the rate of conversion is more in organic listing as compared to PPC, eventually it will be an absolute gain for you.  

This email just tells you the fraction of things we do, our optimization process involves many other technical factors which can be sent to you on your request. If you would like to know more about our services then please write us back else you can give us a call us in our number below.

I know I am not the only company who provides this service, but I can bet that you will get the best quality and service.

Let me know your thoughts and looking forward to work together.
P.S: - This is our marketing strategy that we use the Gmail account. Once you reply us back, the next communication will be from my corporate email ID.

JeNelle,Johnson,jenelle9@hotmail.com,Hello,

I had a few questions about the sizing for your t-shirts.  My husband normally wears an xl in t-shirts but I thought I'd check on the lengh and width of your t-shirts before I order any.  Your zip up hoddie says it runs a size small so I will probably get a 2xl in that style.

Greg,Lewis,gregmlewis2001@yahoo.com,Last week after reading the article on taking your kids fishing (Spring 2013 issue) during my lunch break, I got home from work and decided it was time to take my daughters out.  The pieces fell into place as my wife was leaving them with me while she went to her Zumba class.  We crossed a field into the river and I showed my girls where it safe for them to search for riverbank treasures and "patiently" tried to convince them not to throw rocks too far into the river.  As they started to pile rocks that they HAD to bring home to show mommy, I focused more on my casting.  Reaching farther than my ability usually allows for a tungsten conehead muddler, I felt a hesitation on my backcast.  I turned and saw my older daughter clutching her forehead as she erupted in a piercing scream.  I said some words that, thankfully, she didn't pick up on and then went over to see how bad the damage was.  The blood started pouring out from behind her hand and luckily I had a tissue in my pocket which I put directly on the wound.  The fly took a 1/4 inch chunk out of her forehead at the hair line and left the welt that you'd imagine a tungsten cone at full speed could leave.  When the bleeding stopped, she allowed me to take a picture and promised not to tell Mom what really happened (I can send you the picture and the picture my daughter drew the next day at school about her head wound).  Damn you Drake.  My daughter is a horrible liar and I'm STILL in the dog house.  ,802 734 1393,2013-05-04 19:37:57

Andy,Hill,andy@fishabilities.org,My name is Andy Hill and I recently started a 501(c)(3) organization in Missoula, MT called Fishabilities.  Fishabilities purpose is to assist people with disabilities and allow them to enjoy the outdoors and fishing in a therapeutic environment.  I am graduating on Saturday with my Masters in Social Work along with my entire board of directors.  We all have extensive experience working in the fields of counseling/therapy and working with individuals with disabilities.  I decided to start Fishabilities after working with clients with disabilities and seeing the tremendous impact activities like fishing had in their lives.  When researching this topic, we've found quite a bit of research backing this up.  While there are other organizations that do roughly the same thing (Project Healing Waters, Casting for Recovery, etc), they are limited in their scope as far as clientele is concerned.  Fishabilities will work with anyone, of any age, with any level of disability.

As we are working on getting our name and mission out to the public, I'm wondering if the Drake might be interested in running a story about Fishabilities?

Thanks for your time,

Andrew,Bosway,ambosway@gmail.com,Hi Drake Mag,
I had a tippet piece in the Winter 2012 issue. I have since moved in with a fly fishing english phd student and we are scheming a longer story specifically for the Drake. We are chasing native brookies across the remote hills of central PA. We have targeted several off piste streams and are getting some really good material (fish, pics, writing, etc). 
Is the Drake receptive to longer pieces? Is there a specific timeline for review or editing?

martin,newton,sherlock349@yahoo.co.uk,Any plans to sell your magazine in electronic format online, I have subscribed to fly fishing in salt waters for past 2 years, it works perfectly. The magazine is difficult to find in the states let alone in europe. You are probably missing a trick by not doing it.
Just my thoughts.

I'm just checking up on the status of the current subscription I purchased for my husband, Ron McNamara.  I believe I paid for a 2-year subscription in February 2012, but the last issue I have received is the Winter 2012/2013.  We haven't received anything after that.

John,Law,jtlaw9@hotmail.com,Fellas (and any ladies too),

long time subscriber, first time SWAG buyer - I wanted to reup my subscription for another two years and thought I would buy a tee shirt as well but about droped my glazed long-john in my coffee when I saw the only shipping option cost $20 bucks.  I realize shipping and handling isn't free but in this case it almost as much as the shirt.  I know the Drake is top shelf and i'm sure puttin the product in the envelop and typing the label adds value but in this case (not factoring in the renewal) it basicly doubles the cost.  Is there any way to get shipping cost any cheaper?  Keep up the good work.

Fish on.

wilson,ambale,wambale@gmail.com,Hello  sir,


 Introduction:We just spoke afew minutes ago on phone and you gave me your email address. I would like to introduce myself as a commercial fly tier owning a flies tying factory based in Nairobi, Kenya. I started the art of flies tying at the age of 10 something that was taught by my father who was a tier at fulling mill. At the age of 18 I joined the fulling mill company as a tier and gradually grew to the position of a supervisor watching over quality of the flies done. Having worked there for 10 years it gave me the courage to start my own factory. This came as a result of being introduced to a client from the UK by one friend. That has grown into a big factory with 12 tiers from a base of 3 tiers.

 Kind of business: this is a sole proprietor business operated and done by myself though with too much need in future would not mind partners to join me.The structure of my business is myself as a manager,2 ladies who are in charge of the store who give materials and plan orders alongside myself, they also keep records of materials and let me know what’s missing in stock. I also have 1 person who is the overall quality supervisor, his work is to move around when tiers are doing the work and confirm they are doing great flies. Apart from all this are 8 tiers who are daily doing the work but can be increased in case of need.

 The flies I tie: I mainly do trout flies and salmon flies as my specialties but on noticing that I have so many customers who are in need of saltwater flies employed some tiers who can do those flies. Together with my supervisor at the business we are able to discuss and tie any pattern that is brought across to us. We do not only do traditional flies that are in every website but also to custom flies and own patterns.Can give references some which are from canada just to satisfy to you that our work is good.

 I know that you could probably be having a tier but my thought if given a chance is not to compete but help tie great flies for you just to make sure that your customers are well taken care of .We have grown steadily and given a chance belief would grow further. We would be comfortable being started with small orders just to be checked on our quality, delivery speed and other important things as we grow towards big business. Being a business targeted by many people there have developed scams on the internet who want to steal from genuine buyers and would kindly produce some references or can be paid after delivery for small orders until you get to trust us. Below kindly please find prices I charge bearing in mind all the things needed for a perfect fly. We have to use good quality materials some found locally, others which we import in bulk for orders. I give room to discussion on prices just to make sure both of us are covered well.

Dries -------- 3.2US dollars per dozen

Wet --------- 3.0 US dollars per dozen

Nymphs----- 3.0 US dollars per dozen

Bead heads nymph—3.2 US dollars per dozen

Streamers --------------3.3US dollars per dozen

Streamer bead heads-------3.5 US dollars per dozen

Saltwater flies ------------8.5 US dollars per dozen

Salmon flies black mustard hooks -------------7 US dollars per dozen

Salmon flies black partridge hooks -------------8.5 US dollars per dozen

Salmon flies silver and gold vmc hooks -------------7.5 US dollars per dozen

  Hook types: we are using orient and sun hooks on our trout flies unless our customer wants otherwise which can be discussed and arranged. I used mustard black hooks, silver and gold VMC hooks and partridge hooks on my salmon flies, then on my saltwater patterns use mustard silver in colour hooks

Hope to hear from you maybe asking for samples or with a trial order which can be paid for once you have the flies(around 100 dozens ) as we look forward to good future business with you.

 I know what I have talked maybe little but if you would really want to try us we can discuss and share more that can make us have a fruitful business contact. Kindly please let me know what you think about this and sorry for my long email though had to explain a lot to you. 

Wilson

I just wanted to share something cool with you. I live in Summit County Colorado. I have recently completed the Trout in The Classroom Program. Our high school was the first in the history of the program to release classroom-raised trout into a type A watershed. This is a result of a lot of hard work between our school, the Division of Wildlife, and Trout Unlimited. I was wondering if you guys would write something about it so that maybe other schools become aware that opportunities like this exist,. What do you think? Chris,970 333 1702,2013-07-03 10:29:14

Graham,Jones,gkjflyangler@gmail.com,Hello Editors of Drake,

I love you magazine! It is head and shoulders above another other in the fly fishing field! Although Fly Tying magazine is pretty good.

Just had to comment and give my regards to Gregory Fitz for writing the open letter on proper treatment of bass. I subscribe also to In-Fisherman magazine (for the technical content). Nearly every picture of a bass in that rag is of the 'sport' holding the poor fish either vertically or horizontally supported only by the jaw. My letter to the editor there fell on blind eyes and was never published.

Here in Texas (Oklahoma too), there seems to be an unwritten law that every bass must have  its jaw over-extended prior to release. 

Keep up the good work!

Jack,Donachy,southjetty@hotmail.com,Dear Tom Bie and Geoff Mueller,
I, and then my wife Barbra, recently finished reading the Spring 2013 issue of The Drake from cover to cover. Every article, all the photo captions, the editorial and a good bit of the advertising as well. Enjoyed most of it a lot. John Larison's story "American Muddler" was inspiring - on several levels. We loved the overall layout of the magazine - lots of high-quality single photos accompanied by a few hundred well-written, focused, well-edited words. 

So... a couple of items seemed out of place in your magazine. Sort of like... well, if your magazine were on our breakfast table, and a guest happened to leaf through it and take note of these items we'd feel like we had to make some account of them - like explaining away a friend's bad habits... and perhaps in the process wondering why that person was still your friend. "Page Six Chix." I mean... c'mon. Really? The photos themselves are OK but unremarkable, as are the fish on page six. So, clearly, obviously, the point of interest is the women. Would you run a "Page Six African-Americans?" A "Page Six Little People?" A "Page Six Puppies?" How about "Page Six Alternative Lifestyles?"

Here's a different idea (perhaps better, more evolved, more consistent with what most of the rest of your magazine seems to be about). Why not eliminate the "Page Six Chix" altogether and instead seek out more female writers and photographers to contribute to your magazine and include more photos of women fishing in stories where photos of women fishing actually support the writing? We frequently hear men lament that their wives, girlfriends, or daughters don't fish with them. Both my wife and my adult daughter are avid fishermen and we fish together frequently. I achieved this because a) I was lucky and b) I didn't demean them or condescend to them while teaching them about this great sport. 

I don't know if the page six thing is a deal-breaker. Probably. (Correct that. Barbra says it is, and so it is.) We really, really like your magazine. But... Relationships are about values, and on page six your values stray far from ours.

If Page Six is a deal-breaker, your attempt at humor in the "Ask Trask" column has us turning on our heals and running away. So you want to watch female anglers "make out while mudwrestling." Remarks like this are why women form groups to NOT associate with men when they go fishing. You veered away from being a literate, artistically laid out angling magazine and became a not-very-imaginative "Men's Interest" magazine on that page.

The final item that caught our attention in a not good way was a passage in Tom's article "Chinook Winds." The differences among bull trout, Dolly Varden and Arctic char are subtle, but S. confluentus, S. malma malma, and S. alpinus alpinus are distinct species and can be differentiated in the field. If the difference between, say, Eel River strain steelhead and Skeena River strain steelhead matters (and it does - as does the difference between hatchery steelhead and wild steelhead), then the differences among distinct species of Salvalinus matter, too. What we model as serious anglers and writers in honoring those differences sets a tone for others.

When a restaurant puts "snapper" on the menu, for example, it could be a species of snapper that is overfished, an abundant species of porgy, a type of rockfish that could easily become overexploited, or talapia. This casual attitude toward species identification makes it difficult to effectively manage fish stocks and to develop an educated class of consumers. We're urging you guys to do your part. When you advocate for releasing wild steelhead in Washington State ("Injustice"), we're with you. When you brush off ignorance about which species of char your catching, you lose us.

We'll check back in a few issues to see how things are going. Again, overall... one of the best reads we've had in some time.

Sincerely,
Jack Donachy (cutterlight.com)

I am currently in Afghanistan and started reading The Drake last year (my wife sends out a new issue every time they are released) I am interested in ordering a 3 year subscription along with some swag and back issues.

Troy,Anderson,usmc95@hotmail.com,You guys should offer a deal to those who wish to order multiple issues of your previous issues. My wife sends the new ones to me in Afghanistan which I cruise through in a week and then send back for my library at home. I was looking at getting back issues she can send, but at $10 a pop, I'll pass for now. Just a thought. I sent an inquiry a few days ago with no response. Some get to enjoy the fisheries right now, while others only read about them until we return home, and when we do, keep driving, and look for another hole, this ones taken, we earned it.,,2013-07-12 00:13:25

Copies of the NZ Troutfisher articles can be sent as examples if desired. My experiences include annual trips to the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska, annual trips to New Zealand, Isla Holbox, Christmas Island, a gourmet flyfishing trip outside Paris, and fishing in several other countries.

peter,rein,peter.rein@yahoo.com,Hey Guys

I just got my new issue of Drake yesterday.  But I love the magazine so much that I had to buy it it from the Fishhawk in ATL two weeks ago when I was in there because I didnt want to wait any longer. Getting the Drake is like Christmas morning for me.   But you cant make a child wait til January 15 to open his presents, right? 

I thought subscribers are supposed to receive them first?   

Anyway, I was hoping to get extend my subscription by one issue. When I know its out and I don't get it until two weeks after i see, it makes me crazy because Im dying to read it. So I spent the five bucks. 

Thanks for being the best publication in the sport.

I still, however, have not received the magazine in the mail.  I'm honestly not angry or put off, just more curious.  I assumed it might be on back order because I know the magazine frequently sells out when a new issue comes out.

Sean,Dziedzic ,Sean.Dziedzic@gmail.com,Dear Drake Magazine, I'm a 20 year old college student(Environmental science/sustainability) and I am really looking to get into a career having to do with the outdoors. A friend showed me your magazine a while back and I love it! My favorite part is the "$10 for bait fishermen". You folks have really put together a fantastic magazine. I would love to work with The Drake because I'm getting fairly big into Tenkara and I think it's exploding enough in the US to warrant magazine articles about it. Maybe not a full magazine quite yet but it's getting there. I also absolutely love writing about the outdoors in general, I started a blog a few months ago Getlosthiking.com, so I could write.

My name is Matt Babbitt and I have been reading your magazine for a little over 2 years now, ever since I inherited a former coworkers copy.

I am currently living and working in Washington, D.C., for Living Classrooms of the National Capitol Region, a non-profit environmental education company, as the Coordinator for our DC Fly Fishing in Schools program (dcflyfishing.com).  

In its third year, our program will be working with 200 7th and 8th graders from local underserved communities to introduce them to fly fishing while incorporating pertinent STEM education into our in-classroom lessons and field experiences.

While Denver is a far cast away from D.C., I was writing to see if you have any connections to local fly shops/guides that would be willing to volunteer their time and expertise.  

Thank you for your time and many a great stories.

Bob,Modersohn,bobmodersohn@gmail.com,Hi Tom,
I'm based in Decorah in NE Iowa. Plenty of trout streams here and north into SE Minnesota. The bartenders at a supper club I go to occasionally mentioned there were some guys who play a kind of "trout golf." It seems that they have a course of fishing holes they hit, see who has the best round casting and catching. I envision a picture story with supporting text. Any interest? You can get a sample of my work (photos, writing and bio) at bobmodersohn.com.

John,Vogrinetz,jvogrinetz@tbwifi.ca,Hi, I downloaded the app for your magazine and got the free Spring 2013 preview issue. I've been trying to subscribe with the "in-app" notice but every time it comes up and I try to select to subscribe, the free issue pops up over top of the form so I'm not able to purchase the subscription. It must be some kind of error in the programming. I've been purchasing a number of DVD's in the past few years and noticed that your magazine has been involved with a few of them and I've previously emailed and asked if you were going to offer "The Drake" in an ezine format so I was thrilled to see it offered in the iTunes store. Now I'm frustrated as the app isn't working properly. Hope you can fix it soon....regards John,,2013-09-03 14:41:21

Troy,Anderson,usmc95@hotmail.com,Hello,
I called and left a message as well, but when I returned home today from overseas, I tried on my new blue Drake Mag Guide Shirt and the Large is really small, I will need an XL. How do I go about exchanging it? I live in Fort Collins and was wondering if I could just do a 1 for 1 swap or something by stopping by or whatever. Or if you need my order info I will try to dig that up as the invoice was accidentally thrown away. Anyway, let me know, thanks.

PS - nothing against your new graphics guy but containing the stories within a text box drastically reduces the beauty and drama of your magazine....the pictures are no less alluring, the essays are no less evocative but having the text over the top of those amazing images really did something to place you in those moments that having a little photo fails to realize.

When I turned to the article..it was about the lower peninsula. Below the Mackinac Bridge. We call LP'ers Trolls (live below the bridge) The U.P. is above the Mighty Mac. We have rivers also- the Escanaba; the Fox; the Two Hearted; the Carp- just to name a few.  
Anyway, keep up the great work and if you get a chance come up to the UP, eh?

I have subscribed to the Drake on my iPad (auto-renewing monthly subscription) and received an email a couple days ago stating that the Fall issue of the drake was now available. However upon opening the app it does not list the fall issue or make it available for download and viewing. Can you please advise me when this issue will be available on the ipad app? Is there a reason the paper version is available yet the iPad version has not become available? Is this going to continue in the future...delays in release of the app version??

adam,mcmahon,hkuehl100@pointloma.edu,I was given a 2 year subscription to the Drake magazine in December of 2012. I moved before the spring edition came out and emailed you to make sure you had my new address. You said there would be no problems and that I would be receiving my new magazine at my new address. However, this has no happened. Not only have I not received the spring, summer, & fall magazines, I have gone to a store to purchase them. I would like to be contacted, as I have called and emailed The Drake many times and have not been contacted back. Please call me at 360.591.3424. I am requesting that you subscribe me for another year, as 3/4 of my year was not sent to me.

I'm about to renew my subscription for another 3 years, and with it I wanted to order 3 Drake stikers blue and 2 koozies (1 blue, 1 green) and the calculated shipping cost is $162. 
????? $162 for that ???? must be a mistake. The mag only is I think $ 22 wich is very OK, but for the rest ???? Please let me know if there is a more reasonable rate, or do you just don't want people from overseas to order your stuff?
Besides, thank's for making such a nice mag, better than anything we can get here in Europe.
Best regards from Switzerland,
Adrian,,2013-11-06 10:23:10
Michael,Bassi,michaelkbassi@yahoo.com,The Drake,
  Let me begin by saying that I thoroughly enjoy your magazine.  It's a literal breath of fresh air to read a publication that feels "real" and not pretentious or driven by anything other than the love of fly fishing.  My copies of The Drake are read cover-to-cover, it's stories are shared amongst friends, and it's photos provide inspiration for future endeavors.  
  Inspiration like that is essential when you're in the Army and deployed to Afghanistan.  There isn't a fishable river for thousands of miles.  I know because I've looked, as well as asked the locals using my best Dari and Pashto.  You can imagine it's hard to find a decent fly shop that carries The Drake in these parts.  Luckily before I left, my darling wife bought me a subscription to your magazine.  I deployed with your spring issue and carried it from Texas to Germany to Kyrgyzstan to Afghanistan.  When your summer issue arrived, my wife quickly sent it to me overseas where its been read and re-read several times.  While the pages are worn, the coffee stains are numerous, and the color is just starting to fade, it’s been a loyal and steadfast companion.  
  You can imagine my excitement when my wife informed me the newest edition of The Drake arrived and she was shipping it out immediately!  Several weeks later I received a package postmarked from back home.  On the shipping customs label,  it clearly read “The Drake." Transitioning from one issue of The Drake to the next carries with it a layer of sentiment and nostalgia for your former quarterly companion; however, this feeling quickly fades when you receive your new issue and are overwhelmed by its vibrancy and sheen, and comforted by the fact that old Drakes never die, they remain in the recesses of our memory (and in cardboard boxes in our garage) to contribute towards our passion for fishing.  This time it was different, though.  This time I picked up my “new” edition and saw that The Drake I was holding was a brand new copy of the summer issue!  After confirming with the wife that the magazine I held was in fact that same one she received, my heart sank a little knowing that it would be several more weeks to remedy the situation and receive the autumn issue.
  At your soonest possible convenience, please send a copy of the autumn issue so my dear wife can forwarded it to me overseas.  I’m certain it was an innocent mistake made in the shipping process.  In the interim, I’ll continue searching for Afghan trout streams and taking comfort in your summer issue(s).    
   
Respectfully,
Mike Bassi

Christopher,Brush,ckbrush@mac.com,Do you have any plans for a digital edition? I would subscribe if you did. 

In the fall issue you may have pissed off a slew of yoopers (those who dwell in MI's upper peninsula) by indicating there was an article about the U.P. In the issue. In fact, the article referred to rivers and roads (M-72) located in the mitten.  Such a mistake is liable to incite como clad rage in the vast hoards of fly fishers living on the north side of the bridge--2013 census estimates 12-23. I would normally advise backing off from the bong during the fact checking phase of publication. But WTF what is done is done. Top off the bourbon load up the bong. You say Au Sable; I say Brule. You say Manistee; I say Paint.

KC,Biehn,biehnkc@gmail.com,Why is it that when I click on your website the first thing I see is that the new issue is at my flyshop and not in my mailbox?!

First off I live in a state that has 0, zero, none and zippo independent flyshops in the freaking state. Why do I not have my copy of the drake at my house??????

I'm pissed off if you could not tell. 

I would think paying subscribers are as important or even more important than a local flyshop. We keep flyshops in business but that business is going away faster and faster but the people that actually do the fishing still buy things at a surprising rate.

Pete,Johnson,pwj421@yahoo.com,Dear Drake,

I have a subscription to the hard copy of the magazine and I love it.

I recently got an iPad and signed up for the online version (Drake is my one and only magazine subscription so I was eager to see what the iPad version was like) which comes with a $.99/month subscription fee that gets automatically charged to my iTunes account.  However, when I try to log into Drake's online site to manage my subscription it does not recognize my email address.

Please help as I will continue with my magazine subscription, but I'm not sure I'm getting value out of the monthly charge.

Stephen,Thomson,sthommo111@hotmail.com,I am the fortunate recipient of The Drake magazine on subscription here in Australia.  I had a good and bad afternoon today when I arrived home from work today.  

Both of my fly fishing magazine subscriptions arrived in the post ie The Drake and Flylife.  As I am looking forward to a fourth rainy weekend in a row, I thought I would look to see what was happening in the US first.  To my dismay, my Drake was saturated with all the pages stuck together.  Luckily, Flylife was dry.

I am requesting a replacement copy of the fall edition of The Drake be sent to me. 

I thoroughly enjoy your magazine and the unpredictable delivery times make my anticipation when opening the plastic cover greater.  Combined with young children and a wife unsupportive of my fly fishing adventures, reading The Drake is all the fishing I have been able to do since May.  Thanks for a great publication full of humour and attitude.

Gale,Lefkowitz,gwhale@sbcglobal.net,Hi,
A couple of years ago I bought my husband a subscription to The Drake for a Xmas present. I believe it is time to renew. Do you have a gift option or can I just renew in his name? His name is Hoyt Tarola, same address as mine.
Thanks,
Gale,8054441050,2013-11-29 12:52:27
Mark,Harvey,Harvey@me.com,Gentlefolk,

The first thing I do when I get a new issue of the Drake is troll for any articles on Michigan.  I'm a Homer's homer and was excited to see the U.P. noted in the Tippets section.  The only article I saw was on M-72 in the L.P.  Great article, just not the U.P. If I missed it, I await your biting reply.

I just wanted some clarification on the ordering process.  I just ordered a gift subscription for my husband.  It is intended as a Christmas gift, and I listed the delivery date as 12/26/13.

ken,gargett,kbgargett@bigpond.com,hi, just received the latest issue (fall 2013, 15/3). while it looks terrific, unfortunately it seems that it has sat in water somewhere along the line (the plastic cover did not save it). hence, all pages glued together and it was largely just much. not sure whether it happened your side or this side - i do know my postie is very good and, because i get a lot of deliveries, holds things till he knows i am home. but it could have been anywhere else.
i wonder if you'd be so kind as to send a replacement?
any issues, please let me know.

I just want to changed the name on the Shipping to my husband's name, Ryan Darr. I forgot  that if I put my name under shipping, it will have my name on the magazine.

Can I change the name on the Shipping Address and even the Billing Address to Ryan Darr instead of Julie Darr ?

Michael,Schramm,mpschramm@gmail.com,Hello,
I subscribed to The Drake either early 2013 or late 2012. I am pretty sure I was supposed to receive a Fall 2013 issue, but I am not 100% sure when my subscription ends. I could be wrong, but I thought the Winter 2013 issue was my first one. Anyways, I never received the Fall issue, could you guys check my subscription status? Also, I submitted a change of address on the website over the summer as well when I moved from Delaware to Virginia, but I am thinking that maybe it went to my old address?
I would appreciate if you could check into it. Best.

Keith,Lanham,KeeferLanham@yahoo.com,Well, I finally subscribed a while back and started receiving my subscription at home. And when I moved earlier this year, I dutifully filled out the change of address form well ahead of the next issue. However, after waiting for the Fall issue to come, even giving it a chance to be forwarded from the old address if something bad happened, I have not received the Fall issue. My wife was so tired of me plumbing the depths of an empty mailbox that she went out and purchased the issue to quench my thirst for your lovely magazine. I would appreciate my address being updated, and perhaps credited an issue. Thank you for your attention to this

The last issue of Drake I have received was Spring 2013.  I believe my subscription is paid for at least through 2014.  

I contacted you back in the summer regarding this, and I was told the issues would be sent.  That was never done.

Can some one look into my current subscription and find out why I'm not receiving these?  I miss my Drake.  When completed, could you please forward me the back 2 issue as well.

Rob,Rosario,Robert.b.Rosario@gmail.com,This is probably the 800th note you have received on this...so here's 801st.
Reading the Fall 2013 issue. Love your magazine by the way. Anyways, cover blurb says Michigan's Upper Pennisula. Cool. Having lived here downstate all my life and not fished north of the Bridge, looking to learn a thing or two. Table of Contents: Chasing trout in the UP. Getting excited! Maybe some learned words on coasters on the Salmon Trout River? Two Hearted? Flipping through the pages...UP, UP..nothing. Hold the phone. There is this article on trout. In Michigan, but it's on M72. Which if you hold up your left hand, palm out runs across the middle knuckles of the Mitten state. In The LOWER Pennisula. Not the UP. Again. Love the magazine, but take a look at a map. 

Thanks!
Rob,,2013-12-31 00:32:22
Hank,Rolfs,h.rolfs@centurylink.net,I really enjoyed Trey Combs article in your last issue. He really has a style of writing I truly enjoy. Not realizing he was still getting his writings published I am inspired to make a suggestion: Trey had a book published in 1971 called "The Steelhead Trout". It is an outstanding little book that very artfully tells the tale of how the Steelhead has come to be so highly revered.  How about publishing some excerpts from it in your up and coming issues?  Or, maybe even introduce a series dedicated to the book chapter by chapter.

I realize The Drake is not all about Steelhead, but Trey's contribution to all things we know about pursuing them can not be under stated. And his writing style is very engaging. I think a series like this might be well received.

Just some food for thought.

Keep up the good work.

for the 2nd time I'm trying to contact you online, after NO luck contacting you by phone at all. Getting a little frustrated would be a polite way of describing this situation. I am trying to purchase a subscription as a gift and I cannot work out why it is advertised as $31 for 3 years on your site, then when i put the subscription in the "cart" it comes up as $49 at the point of payment. Can someone please contact me and explain this or help rectify the situation?  
Thanks in advance,

Jamey,O'shaughnessey,Oshaun22@gmail.com,Dear Drake,

I'm 18 and addicted to fly fishing.  I travel a lot and fly fish for everything from tarpon  in the Keys to backcountry brook trout in Montanta to bass my own tied poppers. This spring I am skipping out on the senior spring break at my high school to go permit fishing in Belize with a friend. I love photography and love to write. Is it possible that I could have a page in the Drake to write an entertaining piece about this trip? Possibly even an Add for El Pescador Lodge.

Thomas,Freund,c16tf@dalton.org,To whom it may concern:
We are reaching out as the three 16-year-old heads of a high school fishing club.  We preach conservation, and sustainability in our fishery; our goal is to teach our peers these important fishing ethics, as well as introducing to them the basics of the sport of fly fishing.  Upon the creation of our club, we were pleasantly surprised to find that there was a very high interest level, especially for a school located in the middle of Manhattan.  As the three co-heads of the Dalton Fishing Club, it is our job to find support and benefactors who might be willing to help support our club in some way.  Without support, we will not be able to get our members fishing.  We would love to discuss our current options over email.  We frequently fish the Western Long Island Sound as well as the Croton Watershed, Neversink River, South West Florida, and many other places.  Everywhere we go, the camera gear comes along, too, and we have many more excursions planned that we will document on video as well.  Check us out on Vimeo in our most recent  production: http://vimeo.com/lonelyospreyproductions/bonesofabaco
Please take a look at this and some of our other videos.  We would love to somehow find a way to incorporate The Drake into our productions as well.  We look forward to speaking with you soon, keep those great stories coming, and again thank you for your time.
Best regards and tight lines!

George,Wood,gwood@prudentialunlimited.com,Hi folks,

More than once I have looked at pictures of Permit and said to myself, "That looks like a giant Pompano."

It was nice to have my suspicions confirmed by Mike Holliday!  I've caught a few Pompano randomly off the coast of NC and have always thought they were pretty cool fish.  

I'm trying to think of a short reprieve from the frigidity of my Boston climes and his article has inspired me to consider replicating his experience with these fish.  I'd hate to go in blind, though.  Any chance you could connect me with him so I can learn a little more?

I get it if that's too big of an ask, but nothing ventured, nothing gained!

Peace,

mike,percelli,recaptureflyfishing@gmail.com,Here is an opportunity to aid in producing an incredible project.  We are looking to spread the word. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Could we also post this on your message board? thank you in advance. 

http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/recapture-a-fly-fishing-film


Recapture is a Documentary about Mike Percelli, a New York State fishing guide who has always received joy from casting a fly rod since he was introduced to the sport by his father at the age of ten. Mike watched his father Joel battle Leukemia for 12 years before it eventually claimed his life.  Since the death of his father, Mike has been tourtured by the fact that he was never able to physically say goodbye before his passing. To achieve a sense of closure and to honor his father, Mike decided to create a Fly Fishing film as a memorial, dedicated to portraying the activity that cemented their bond. 

With the help of the award winning documentary film crew, Cinema Architects, Mike and a group of friends will produce a feature length film about Fly Fishing and the connections it helps cultivate across all aspects of life. The team hopes to enter a condensed version of the film into next years Fly Fishing Film Tour for the viewing pleasure for all of North America. 

Your donations do not only go towards the production, but provide you with incredible trips as a thank you for your generosity from the Recapture crew.
*Donation levels range from $5 to $1,000

Your contribution at the higher levels entitles you to guided trips in both the Fresh and Saltwater: 

-$300 Donation Level- Provides you and a friend with a full day float trip down NY's Delaware River. 
-$500 Donation Level- Provides you and a friend with a 6-Hour Charter on the Long Island Sound. 
-$1,000 Donation Level- Provides you with 2-days of fishing and filming with the Recapture crew on NY's Salmon River. One nights lodging and food is provided, in addition to 		one dozen hand tied flies for your adventure.  
 
1% of all contributions to the project will be donated to a Leukemia or Cancer society. 

Your support will help document an incredible journey of one man to not dwell on the death of his father, but celebrate his life by pursuing the dreams they created together.

I was at my local Orvis the other day and they had the winter issue out on their counter top. It made me wonder where my issue was as I have a subscription. Should my copy have arrived already or is it still early for consumers to get their copy in the mail? Thanks for any information! I always look forward to reading the current edition!

Richard,Richard A. Zettervall,razduck52@yahoo.com,I am contacting you to inform you that I will not be patronizing your Company due to your support and sponsorship of the Native Fish Society. I will be sharing this with my friends and fellow anglers who want to see an active and bountiful sports-fishing industry in which all Oregonians can enjoy the same privileges I have had as a Native Oregonian of over 6 decades. I want my children and grandchildren to be able to go out and catch a Hatchery Steelhead and be able to take it home. The future of Hatchery Steelhead is threatened by the Native Fish Society and will not support companies who support this cause. 

Thank You,

Ray,Bowes,raykero@outlook.com,I just came across your magazine for the first time in the form of the Winter 2013/14 edition.   Loved it, but it would appear to be as rare as hen's teeth up here and impossible to find anywhere near my small town in the interior of B.C.  

Is a subscription available to Canadians?   If so, I would be grateful for details.

Ben,Taylor,bentayfly@aol.com,Gentlemen: [I have just emailed you, but am repeating my email here]
    I have just finished putting together a book about a legendary Fly Fisherman who lived in Northern California (Monte Rio) and passed away 19 years ago. However we still talk about Bill Schaadt today as if he were still with us. 
    Some friends of mine have suggested I contact "The Drake" in the hope that you will review my book for your readers (and I promise to subscribe). And I have heard many good things about your magazine from those who suggested I contact you.  
    You may visit my website  billschaadt.com  to get an idea of the book, and I would also be happy to send you a copy if you will tell me where to mail it.
    Thanks and I look forward to hearing from you,  Ben Taylor

A couple of good fishing buddies (from PEI Canada)and I are trying to start a non-profit group (PEI Fly Anglers) to promote fly fishing, fly tying and the importance of catch and release. Also, bring to light the poor quality of watersheds and lack of work on our streams and rivers. Our government biologist are dropping the ball and have been doing so for a long time.  For us to become a non-profit we must incorporate, the cost will be around $1300. Would you be willing to assist us so we could fund raise the money needed to start up.

Jeffery,Raczkowski,swungfly@yahoo.com,Tom,

I have been buying your magazine since day one.  Needless to say, it is a publication like no other!  The humor, wit, essays, photography, and conservation make it a flagship model of what fly-fishing periodicals should be.  I recently created an account through the website and posted a very modest and friendly introduction and was told to get lost.  My response was inappropriate for sure, but the barrage of comments turned me off to the site completely.  I belong to a small social media community of fly-fishers and I wanted to expand a bit and join The Drake.  Needless to say, I am deeply disappointed.  Not that you can babysit everyone in a social media setting, but some of these folks need to be reprimanded.  Again, I accept some responsibility, but I thought there would be a standard for appropriateness.  I am a fly-fisherman with 25 years of experience so I was hoping to join a community in which I could learn things and pay it forward as well.  I am so angered that I thought about not buying anymore magazines, but I will take the high road and assume that I ran into some infants who cowardly use social media to boost their own egos.  Perhaps I should have read the newbie introduction before posting.  I read it after the fact and do understand the vibe of the site, but these folks crossed the line.  I want to thank you for producing the greatest fly-fishing magazine that I ever laid my eyes on, but unfortunately I want nothing to do with the site.  

Sincerely,
Jeff Raczkowski,,2014-03-12 13:41:12

I would like to introduce to you our new video: INSIDE YOUR MIND

https://vimeo.com/89440724

I would be glad to know what you think about our video...

below some comments
orvis.com said :I dig it when someone tries to make something really new with fly-fishing video. This is a little art piece that tries to capture the mental processes of the tier exploring his passion.

Lemouching said : Do you see yourself in that vid? It happens to me all the time, not at the vice, I don’t tie my flies, but everywhere, a gentle breeze, a sound a smell and I’m gone. My head is gone, I see fish, I’m instantly by the water. I cannot help it and you are like me. We are obsessed! One track mind : fish! We are powerless, we suffer from compulsive obsession.


waiting for your feedback

franck,marcault-derouard,kifrmd@gmail.com,Hi,

I purchased a few days ago your 4 issues offer (order # AB- 5207).

Could you please include the spring 2014 issue and send the 3 next ones, instead of sending me the 4 next issues (summer 2014 to spring 2015) ?

Thanks

Regards

Franck

Ross,Cunningham,ross@fiveriverslodge.com,Good morning,

We really love your Fly Shop Friday feature here at Five Rivers, and we'd love to know if or how we could contribute. The Five Rivers Lodge Fly Shop has the largest fly selection in Montana, and one of the largest selections in the country, and the lodge owner, Jay, is a great interview subject. We'd be happy to host you, if you'd like to visit.

Here's a little more info about the shop:

Feel free to contact me at ross@fiveriverslodge.com.

Thanks and enjoy the rest of your week.

Sincerely,

Ross Cunningham,,2014-04-07 09:22:33

Thomas,Hodson,tfxhodson@hotmail.com,Good afternoon.  Last Fall I purchased a subscription to your magazine through the iTunes store.  I love the magazine, but seem to be having trouble with getting the new magazines to show up on my iPad when they are issued.  I see that the Spring issue is already out, but it never showed up in my iPad "Newsstand."  How can I fix?  I got billed my monthly amount and thought to myself that the new issue should be out.  When I checked and confirmed that it was, it should have showed up in the Newsstand on my iPad.  I had the same trouble with the Winter edition.  Help!,860-614-3656,2014-04-07 12:57:04

Christopher,Christopher W Cummings,chris@freestonesales.com,I work with a line of leather goods called Moore & Giles.  We have recently launched a new bag.  It is a $1200 retail Cast and Blast bag for the guy who has everything.  I have a bit of a fly fishing addiction and worked with the designer to develop the bag.  I wanted a bag that I could use to get all of my gear to and from the river or field.  The removable waterproof liner can be washed, dried, and put back in the bag when it gets too dirty.  See more info at our website below.  We also do a Bison Shotgun Case that is pretty amazing.  I am not sure when you will be doing your next round of gear reviews but I would love to get you a sample.

About a month ago I received a two year subscription to The Drake as a birthday present. I saw that a new issue of the magazine is out, and I was wondering if there was an issue with my subscription processing  or is it typical for the for there to be some lag time. The email the subscription was purchased under was mommajean49@yahoo.com.

The local media have been captivated by all things weed subsequent to legalization in Colorado.  I suppose it was inevitable that there would be a story about fishing and the Rocky Mountain High in the Spring 2014 issue.  Visitors to CO should know that the potency of the state of the art product is about ten times that of what they were inhaling years ago. Partaking while fishing is bound to make you a little less certain of your footing or whether you just saw what you thought you saw at the top of that seam. As for myself, I prefer to save the smoking for after the rods have been put away.  CO citizens should be aware that there have been rumors of profiling Colorado plates for traffic stops for those leaving the state.    ,303-484-8417,2014-04-10 17:42:56

Amery,Seay,Amerywestseay@gmail.com,I just had an idea for a great section. About the American trout bum. The real trout bum, not the yuppies like myself. I fish often with Bryce cadion, the midge master.  He lives in his car or crashes at friends houses and fishes the white river in northern Arkansas every day. Wins one-fly contests and sells the grand prize rod at the event. He taught me how to fish for the beaver tailwater trout, using 7x tipper and thread midges. Just an idea, feel free to contact me if you guys are remotely interested in getting in contact with Bryce. He looks the part as well, all bearded and toothless. I don't imagine Bryce has many more good years on the river.  I'm honored to have learned from him. ,4796444873,2014-04-15 21:44:51

Jared,Zissu,zissujn0@sewanee.edu,My name is Jared Zissu,

I am currently a sophomore studying Natural Resources and Business at the University of the south in Sewanee TN. Here at Sewanee I am starting a Trout Unlimited Chapter, I play collegiate Soccer and Squash and I am a member of volunteer student fire department. We make up 18 select individuals who dedicate 100 hours per week to the community. 

In the last 6 months I have been developing a company called Fly Lords. At the moment we are a social media outlet focused around Instagram, Twitter and facebook. I run the company myself and we have over 6,000 followers (growing rapidly). I am emailing the Drake mag because I feel as if I can contribute some of the work I am doing to what you guys do. Obviously you are in an entirely different league, I envy the name that your company has produced and I am eager to read every magazine I can get my hands on. That being said, just by messing around on Instagram I have developed some cool and innovative fly fishing ideas. For instance I introduced something called Fish Flop Friday a few weeks ago. This phenomenon is growing rapidly and is honestly hilarious. People #fishflopfriday on fridays of every week and upload pictures of "Flop Shots". I think this could make an awesome page on your magazine and I am willing to contribute all of the pictures I sift through on a daily basis. 

Anyway being a just a sophomore in college, I spend much of my time at school during the semester. This summer, besides going to guide school in Montana I am looking for work. I am obviously spending time working on my company but I would love to help out with any aspect of the drake mag. Whether it is contacting people for you, finding cool photos, developing a new Fish Flop Friday page, or Fly Lords shot of the week page. Even finding "page six chix". I have my own version of that called "Catch of the Week".  I have about 2 months this summer where I am looking for work. Even if it is an unpaid internship, I would love to help your company out in any way possible. I am eager to get my hands on any aspect of the fly fishing community. I have also made some amazing contacts along my journey thus far. I Know some very talented artists and graphic designers that I have been working with on a weekly basis, people who could have awesome articles in the Drake mag that I could even interview myself. Fly Lords is also starting a sector for gear reviews. I have a team of talented fly fishers who make up the "Fly Lords". People guiding in Alaska and upstate NY. 

I am sure this email is probably in the wrong place, but whoever reads this if you could pass it along to the right person that would be great.

Hope your having a great spring!

Matt,Thompson,matt@greenrealtymt.com,I just wanted to let you know that everybody at Drake does an amazing job!! I look forward to every issue that comes out. Thanks for everything you do and the time you put into it.

I am a full time fly fishing guide in Montana and love trout fishing. I was privileged enough to be on the show Guided on the World Fishing Network. I am going to be on Trout TV this year and things seem to be going really well for me in this amazing career of helping people getaway from the stress of normal life. 

I am writing you today because I would love to be apart of your magazine. If that means just a little or a lot, it doesn't matter. I just love what you are doing for the sport and would love to help support what you already do. 

I could write articles or have someone from the Drake come out and fish with me. They could share their experience of the Big Horn River or any other river I guide. It would be amazing to be apart of such a great magazine. 

Please let me know a way I could be apart of keeping this wonderful sport healthy and fun.

Thanks so much,

John ,Gibson ,gibsonjohn43@gmail.com,      We thank The Drake for its continuing coverage of the land and water access problem we are experiencing in Montana.  The problem in a nutshell is that landowners, some of whom are absentee, are asserting private property rights where no such rights exist and are preventing sportsmen form accessing public land and waters.  It has been estimated that 800,000 acres of public lands in Montana alone have been closed to the public.

     Sportsmen from all over the country come to Montana expecting to enjoy recreating on their public lands but are too often faced with illegal “No-Trespassing” signs that prevent them from using what is arguably public domain.

    The Public Land and Water Association is an organization in Montana whose single mission is to  protect and restore access where it is being denied.

     Montana’s liberal stream access laws were just recently reaffirmed by the Montana Supreme Court in a case brought by PLWA against Atlanta media mogul James Cox Kennedy, an absentee landlord on the Ruby River, a state designated blue-ribbon trout stream.  It should be noted that Montana  Trout Unlimited supported PLWA in this fight with legal help and a $10,000 donation.

     Certainly, litigation is not the preferred solution to these problems.  We agree with Miles Nolte, “Mending Fences” The Drake, Spring 2014, pp. 50-55, that more civility and compromise is needed between landowners and sports men.  Legal action is obviously the last resort and should be used only when the parties are unmovable.  For example, in another recent case, PLWA, the Forest Service, and a landowner came together on a solution to build a road opening -------acres to sportsmen on Cherry Creek south of Big Timber, Montana.  This is the way to go when possible to avoid costly litigation and even more costly hard feelings between sportsmen and landowners.

     For more information on PLWA activities, and to join the fight, visit www.plwa.org.

Donnie,Dahl,donnie.dahl@gmail.com,My younger brother was hit with an IED while serving in Afghanistan a few years back.  He lost his best friends and was injured himself.  He has suffered with PTSD ever since.  His cure is not a pill or therapy, it is fly fishing.  He is currently working on a start up organization to help other service memmbers who suffer from PTSD ease their pain with a fly rod.  He recently recieved the Purple Heart fly award from Project Healing Waters.  Can you spare a space in an upcoming issue to share his story and to possibly help others with PTSD?  If so,  I will pass on his contact info.

Thanks,

I'm 14 y.o. and I live in the troutless desert that is Illinois.  Sure I can have my parents drag me to the troutvana areas of Michigan of southwest Wisconsin. Rather I find my self hunting bass, pike, musky (with a "y") and carp. I applaud you for not just focusing on trout and fellow salmonoids, but also warmwater stuff as well.,708 625 6248,2014-06-02 10:29:20

Spencer,Cordovano,Scvpinfo@gmail.com,Howdy,

I just shot a video fly fishing Dorado down in Baja, for Smith Optics new web campaign "Great Days". I have some excellent photos from the trip as well. I was wondering you guys may be interested in them, for editorials or a story,  and who I would talk to. My photo package is more feel good than conclusive, since my main objective was video, there are not many photos of fishing, but a lot of the environment around the catch. 

Thanks,

Spencer

Jeff,Welker,jwelker3@cox.net,Dear Subscriber Folks;

In a fit of house cleaning, I'm working to reduce my sporting magazine subscriptions to my most favored publications. The Drake is at the top of my list of favorites. Here is my problem and why I'm contacting you. As I near my 12th lustrum, I find that my memory is not as rock solid as it used to be. Accordingly, I can't remember if I've let my subscription to the The Drake lapse or if it is still active? I'd sincerely appreciate it if you could confirm my subscription status one way or another. That will let me know if I should renew/lengthen my current subscription or apply as a new subscriber.

Your kind assistance is sincerely appreciated;

Jeff Welker,480-209-7167,2014-06-24 10:43:31

Glenn,Carson,gflyfisher@juno.com,Drake,

Thanks for publishing “What Smallies Tell Us” by Pete McDonald in your summer issue.   It hit home.  I live in the heart of PA’s Cumberland Valley on a large feeder stream to the Susquehanna (the Conodoquinet).  I bought our 1931 Sears Craftsman home because there were lots of rising smallmouth in the front yard.  I spent 35 years wading and fly fishing that stream and the Susquehanna, mainly above the old Rockville railroad bridge located right below my brother-in-laws riverside home in Marysville, PA.  It was incredible and I did it at least two or three nights a week for much of the bass season every year.  For 20 years I worked a mile from Bob Clouser’s shop in Middletown, PA, and I spent countless lunch hours there and evenings fly fishing for smallies downstream near a friend’s home in Bainbridge, PA.  For 18 years our family vacationed on a small lake in Maine, where my son and I fished for smallies.  Every year the night we returned to PA in August we ended up right back in the Susquehanna fishing the white fly hatch after the 12 hour drive home from Maine...  From age 6 through his late teenage years, my son and I made countless overnight float trips down the Susquehanna or Juniata rivers with my brother-in-laws and their two sons. It was all about family and the smallmouth fishing, but I haven’t floated like that in almost eight years.  For over 32 years I have worked in the groundwater remediation business attempting to clean up old factory sites, but I think I’ve learned more about the health of a body of water as a fly fisherman standing in a stream and watching than I ever could from reading sample result data sheets from a lab.  After 34 years, we just sold our home, and are moving to a house situated near a small local trout stream and a friend’s pond.  I’m going to set up a small luthier’s shop to make classic old school banjos in my semi-retirement there but the real reason may be that I just can’t stand looking out seeing a stream with no rising smallmouth anymore.  I now find myself surrounded by thousands of somewhat robotic suburbanites who enjoy living near our 100 yard wide meandering stream but who would also much rather have a putting green like and dandelion free yard than a healthy stream, they have no idea of what it was like, and how their weekly doses of lawn chemicals have helped to change something that was so incredible, and how can you convey that to people who really just don’t seem to care?  What I would give for one more week of evenings on the Conodoquinet or Susquehanna the way it used to be…..

Shelley,Rogers,rogersnyc@aol.com,I have been trying for 1/2 hour to renew a subscription for 1 year for my son.  Your website keeps telling me that I have to enter a password.
I enter a password and I get a message saying something to the effect that my email address is already "informed"????  And that I should log into my account.  I try another password and I get the same message.
What password?  I have no recollection of entering a password into some account with this magazine.  And why should I?  If we all had passwords to every last thing we subscribe to we would need a separate address book.  I couldn't possibly remember of I entered a password the last time  subscribed.  This is preposterous.
Please get back to me ASAP.  I just want to order another year of The Drake for  my son.  And furthermore, I was informed on you web site that I would receive a link to get a NEW password - which never happened.  It's really annoying. 
I tried getting a NEW subscription - not a renewal - and it pestered me the same way.
Please contact my email address and let me know how I can get a new subscription for one year.,212-502-6665,2014-07-13 11:31:00

Timothy,Leahy,timothy.j.leahy05@gmail.com,Dear Drake Mag,

I recently found out that the US Postal service has not been delivering my mail for no apparent reason. I have lived in the same address for over a year and nothing has changed. I am currently investigating into the matter, and it looks like either someone has been stealing my mail or flat out not doing their job. The post office informed me that all undelivered mail is sent back to the original sender. I was wondering if it was possible to find out if you have received any returns under my name and address? This will help me track down how long this has been going on as well as find out what issues I have not received. The last issues I got in the mail was the 2014 Spring edition. Any information you can provide would be greatly appreciated. Thank you and I look forward to your response. 

Sincerely,

Mike,Kemp,minutemn@gmail.com,I am an old man now, but I grew up flyfishing the Tennessee River between Guntersville and Scottsboro, in the general area of a place called Preston Island, down the mountain from Grant. I fished extensively from the latter 50s until the late 70s. The hottest fly I ever used, and I used it almost exclusively, was a brownish yellow with 'mottling' of brown underneath. White 'whiskers'. This was a small floating fly, cork, or some very light wood, with a very small bream hook. They came on 'cards', were evidently locally produced somewhere in that area. And when the flies were out, it was absolutely sure-fire. Many times, more times than I could count, I fed the family for a solid week, every night, from the daily catch, bream with some relatively small bass and stripe mixed in. I find it difficult to describe the fly, but I would recognize it instantly if I saw it. Something tickles my mind that it was a 'Sportsman' brand, from the printing on the card.,601-657-1000,2014-07-24 13:33:30

It was the fish of my life caught on a 3 weight rod which ended up being an exciting fight. I was lucky enough to have a friend with me to get all of the pro pictures.

Bob,Hallock,ontheflytoo@yahoo.com,Hello-
I have just submitted Two change of address requests.  Of course, I have moved only to one place, but I formerly lived in CO and recently held a temporary PO Box in Massachusetts.  I am now settled into a home here in Massachusetts and have submitted a change request from my former CO home to my new home and also from my temporary PO Box to my new home to cover all bases.

Hopefully this does not cause confusion.  Will certainly miss the fishing along the Front Range and general region but will be able to chase some Stripers in the salt here...

Change your 'From' line for subscription confirmations from what it currently is (Info) to something more descriptive. May I suggest: Drake Mag, Drake Magazine, Drake Mag Info, etc.

You're likely getting hit by spam filters and that may in turn harm your email marketing.

Just a thought.

David,Choi,duly@gmx.com,
Dear Brave and Open Minded Personnel ;
 
Do you have any interest over the hombre, between heaven and the earth?
 
Basis on daily newspaper offered terminology, my experienced case, ‘hombre’, is known as follows, which I like to disclose its extraordinary case toward your side.
 

천인 (天人)
1.	el cielo y el hombre, Dios y hombre
2. hombre, de doctrina
3. hombre, de talento, hombre, muy guapo
4. 佛教術語，天界中之有情
 
As I have been experienced of harsh condition since 2001,
Basis on controlling and monitoring status in homeland, S Korea,
This status makes me be eligible to apply Asylum seeker’s status toward Austria.
 
While residing in refugee camp in Vienna, Austria,
I experienced of strange condition similar to ‘hombre’ or more than its status.
 
Basis on my memory,
I did not speak Buddha or some of related word to the public site toward the camp dwellers. 
On my document package which I am holding at my file from Austria, 
On the sheet, given document there is the content of “Buddha Gekommen”.
 
While residing in camp, named detention center, chased by two local police men in there, I could barely get out of the camp via submit withdrawal from Asylum Seeker’s status in Austria. On the same day, I could experience ‘Hombre’ again.
 
Back to original status in homeland, S Korea,
No job, no income, encountered by financial limit not acquiring of consecutive income line, I am investing most of daily life time in searching of living cost.
 
Anyway,
Looking back of my last decade,
I experienced of strange condition repeatedly from the pre-joined work sites.
 
Among the pre-framed work sites,
I was in Iraq, Congo, East-Timor, Cambodia, Malaysia, in searching of living cost to survive.
 
Ironically,
I was led into conflict zone and war zone to survive during the last decade.
This makes me have joined over 45 different work sites among Koreans.


 
To offer my extraordinary case toward your side, I am ready to disclose.
For this matter, I urge you to visit my side and take image of my experience.
 
While residing in Austria, I was comma status in public site, known as parking lot, where many people were gathering.. over 3 hours at least.
Its strange status experienced at detention center, refugee camp in Vienna.
 
I have experienced of body floating toward the Air could look down my figure etc.
 
Its strange experience was not once.
I have experienced several times, repeated experience since my boyhood period.
 
Believing that, there.. experienced affairs were crossing the life line toward the heaven.

Its experience was very vivid.
I am eligible to tell, how its condition was connected toward the immense territory of universe
 
For this matter,
Its cause would be disclosed toward animation program or related personnel.
 
As the human being related, strange condition is highly researched, long know-how basis on significant research from a reliable site, I would urge you to come and see my case as long as I am ready to disclose my case to the public.
 
Why this is reasonable to the public?
While experiencing of 45 different business sites as the temporary hired status
Including of war zones and conflict zones from the Korean business owners’ sites,
I could have vivid mind to survive, even if I have been repeatedly placed at the edge of life, in dangerous sites such as conflict zone and war zone since 2001.
 
Its strange experience would be key asset toward the people, who pursue strict life under the Sky.

Toward the reliable anime program personnel, my harsh experience from pre-joined 45 work sites including of war zones duties and hombre 천인 (天人) experience would be disclosed.  Surely, its content would be brought pivotal point among audience.



Sincerely,

(David) Don Young Choi

Thank you for the warm regard.
 
My harsh story was introduced on April 14, 2014 at Austria TV.
 
Due to have been placed at 'Government Sanction' basis on TV forum via local TV forum,
my case, Asylum Seeker's case was eligible to be extended in Vienna region.
 
On the date of April 18, on scheduled day of first interview time,
I was chasing by two local police men.
 
Encountered by edge of Asylum Seeker's status,
I could barely enter Camp basis lawyer's office and let her know of my Withdrawal of Asylum seeker's condition.
 
Basis on local ... camp dweller, named refugee camp,
my story was key issue among the camp residency.
 
I was the Korean,
I had the extraordinary case of Asylum seeker's status, no phone, not enough money, many of skin scar sites on the body…
I was the sole person, who brings keen interest toward the camp dwellers.
Among the kids in detention center, I was known as frog, brave hearted character, bring positive image toward the young hearts.
 
In here,
I suggest you to develop my case into commercialized.
 
Believing that,
my harsh experience since my young boyhood,
its case would be brought keen interest among the potential audience.
 
Attached files are related information to be considered.
 
I am awaiting any of further and positive notice from your side.
 
Sincerely,
 
(David) Don Young Choi

Molly,Whitney,molly@waterwatch.org,To the folks at The Drake, 

I am writing to submit a request for a donation of a year's subscription to The Drake to be included in our environmental organization's annual gala auction in November. Our core supporters are mostly river lovers (fishermen and anglers) who would be thrilled to become familiar with and bid on a subscription to The Drake. The auction is our major source of annual revenue, earning upwards of $150,000. The event includes a wine reception, formal dinner, live entertainment and silent auction. This year the event is held at The Tiffany Center in Portland on November 8th, 2014. We expect over 350 supporters to attend the 12th Annual Celebration. A myriad of professionals attend our event including those in the legal, non-profit and business community.Last year, more than 200 individuals and businesses contributed items and services to our auction and helped us have the most successful event to date.  Through your donation, guests and supporters will see firsthand that you value healthy rivers in Oregon. Many others will learn of your commitment to healthy rivers through the various methods we use to promote and advertise the event to the public, river enthusiasts and anglers across the state. Donors information will be displayed on our website and in the program at the event.There will also be a display placard with the donor's information next to the item given. The event and sponsors will be promoted to our membership base of about 1,000 people and through Twitter and Facebook. 

A little bit about WaterWatch:
Since 1985, WaterWatch has pursued a single clear mission: To protect and restore flows in our rivers to sustain the native fish, wildlife, and the people who depend on healthy rivers. WaterWatch was the first organization in the West to seek structural reform of antiquated water laws to protect and restore our rivers. For 28 years, WaterWatch has protected and restored water to Oregon’s rivers, streams and lakes for fish, wildlife and people. Feel free to learn more about us at www.waterwatch.org. 

A subscription to The Drake would add great value to our auction and help us meet our annual fiscal goals so that we can continue our important work preserving Oregon's rivers. Attached is a donation form. 
Thank you in advance for your time and consideration. 

Sincerely,

Ryan,Morningstar,r.r.morningstar8@gmail.com,I placed an order (order number AB-6539) on September 4th, 2014. The order was for a one year subscription, a black coffee mug, and a sticker. I received my package on September 13th. The box was not damaged on the exterior. Inside I found the black coffee mug with a big chip out of it. I took a photo immediately and emailed Drake Magazine at info@drakemag.com with that image attached. I also mentioned that there was no sticker, and I understand that the new issue will be coming out shortly so understand it not being included. I got no response.

Yesterday, September 16th, I attempted to call the number that is provided for a contact number and got no return call. Just looking for a little help here on getting this situation rectified. If someone could contact me either by phone or email, that would be appreciated.

Bill ,Obear,bearpath@comcast.net,Hi -

I love your magazine. I decided to subscribe and sent you a check for $18.00 dated 8/13/14.  The check cleared my bank about Aug. 25th.  I'm assuming that you publish a fall issue and am trying to find out if you have mailed that issue already. I just noticed that it's October 1st and I haven't received this issue yet. Thanks for checking into this for me.

Best Regards,

Bill Obear

Randy ,Rospopo,troutyeah@aol.com,
Hello, My name is Randy, I am an avid steelhead fisherman and I really love your The Drake fishing magazine.I first spotted your magazine when I was up fishing the pere marquette at a buddy of mines house.Your magazine is filled with tons of info that an angler can apply to catch the big ones.I really think this might be the most deadly tool to use for fresh water angling I think I might be "hooked" ha.It so awesome unfortunately I have never personally owned an issue of your magazine. I would really like to get my hands on one. I look forward to seeing more of your fishing reading materials in the future I am also writing this email to request stickers or maybe a sample issue of your magazine or anything if available? .I would really love to see what I have been missing .I would love to try to get my local tackle shops and magazine book stores to to carry your products if you would like. I am good friends with the owner and he is smack dab in the middle of the st joe river in Indiana and we have 3 steelhead runs a year including a salmon run. If I could show him one of your issues .I bet could get him to buy from you. I would also love to use them to spread the word of your amazing magazine and show my love of the Drake fly fishing magazine company to the world.If you cant send out anything, that is fine.Just keep up the great work. Your friend, Randy the fisherman.   my address will be at the bottom.

I entered my e-mail address and chose a password as requested.
However, nowhere did I see an opportunity to select a "username"...and when I went to log in to your site again, it asked for a username...which I don't have.  Tried my e-mail address, tried my name, my old username,etc.--no luck.  Can you help please?

I personally could put up some big numbers in this contest and so could many members of our club.  We can't and we won't because we refuse to join social media.

Peter ,Douma,peterdoumag@gmail.com,Hi guys,
Huge fan of the magazine, it's my favorite fishing publication. My name's Peter Douma and I am a journalism student at Monmouth University in NJ. I've been really interested in maybe submitting something for the magazine, so that I may combine my passion with my area of study. The only issue is I'm not really sure what type of article to submit. I fish at least 5 nights a week during the striper season and do a lot of wetsuit type fishing here on the Jersey shore as well as Montauk, NY. Maybe I could do something involving this. Any suggestions would be really helpful. Thank you,

For some reason, it is not available yet.

Also, I have purchased a number of back issues which I enjoyed reading.

Could you explain what benefit I get from having a monthly iphone subscription?  If I have to pay for digital issues as they are released, why do you need a subscription?

mark,wilhelm,mwwdmdmsd@gmail.com,Hello,
Comments on the digital subscription service.
I had paper subscriptions for a while and went to digital. Apparently I needed to accrue $$ each month to have enough to download an issue. No problem I bought the summer issue and when you notified me that the fall issue was available I went to look for it. The fall issue still does not show up in my App.
The other day there was a notice to update my Drake Magazine App and I swept the icon (not while in the App) and instead of updating the App it downloaded the Summer issue that I didn't want because I already read it. So now I need to accrue more $$.
Now I love the Drake and I'm not crying about 5 bucks but it is a little irritating.

Do you run into this often?

I'll buy a paper one at the store. I like digital though.

Chris ,Jenson,cj.fishnutz@gmail.com,Just wondering how to submit videos.  I have a YouTube channel (like everyone else on the planet) and I have a couple that may fit the personality of the Drake.  
    For a little humor, this one shows how to catch a fish with a pine cone (spoof that I've had to take off my Facebook because everyone keeps congratulating me on being such a master fisherman)...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-CivsIZXTQ.  
    And this one:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atax7l8gkvk .  I thought it would be interesting to make a fly rod stream side and see if I could catch a trout with it and maintain any semblance of a quality experience.  
    Like any budding videographer, I would appreciate if someone from the Drake would check out my channel at https://www.youtube.com/user/CJFishNutz.  I have been having WAY too much fun making movies.  Thanks for any attention that you can throw my way!

Michael,Salomone,AdventureSal@yahoo.com,So I am trying to watch the Broncos and Seahawks game last night while flipping through my new issue of The Drake when I come across the little piece by Christian Shane, River's Last Drift. Now you always have high quality reading material not easily found in any other publication but this little piece had me completely. I found myself not even able to watch the game but rather curling up on the dog bed beside my 17 year old Brittany, Lola. A short time later I merely showed the photo to my wife and she began reading on her own. A few minutes later she emerges from the magazine with tears on her cheeks. That was all it took to get my 13 year old daughter to read the piece. Definitely the best five bucks I have spent in a long time! Thanks to you Tom for a great magazine.,970 618 2566,2014-10-24 15:20:58

Kent,Gilder,kentkiaofbrockville@hotmail.com,For many years I have read your magazine and enjoyed it . I get issues wherever I
can. It is very difficult to buy this magazine in Canada. When I am in the U.S. fishing, I try to
find the most recent issue either @ Wiley,s Flies or The Hungry Trout. I have been unable
to get the last 2 issues Summer and Fall. How would you like to start sending subscriptions
to Canada? I would be willing to sign up. I feel like I am being deprived of receiving the best
Fly Fishing magazine period. I have had a Drake logo on my truck for more years than I
can remember. How about it? Kent Gilder.....,,2014-10-28 17:32:58

Love your guys magazine and wanted to share a video that I am trying to promote. I went on a fishing trip with my dad for Columbus Day weekend in Montauk and fly fished for both False Albies and Stripers and had the trip of a lifetime. Caught more fish than I could imagine. Here is the video and I was wondering if you guys have any contests coming up or might be able to feature the video but just trying to get the video out for more people to see it. It was shot with a Go Pro hero 3+ black edition. Hope you enjoy it!

Hello Tom – just a note concerning two little-known angling book collections held in the Rare Books Collection at the University of Wyoming in Laramie.  One library consists of ca. 500 titles from a private collection, including rare heritage editions.  The second  commemorates the untimely death of Gary LaFontaine.  A short write-up that calls attention to this angling resource is seemingly appropriate and relevant to the readers of Drake.  What do you think?  ,307 399 2185,2014-11-18 11:03:29

Colin,Pittendrigh,sandy.pittendrigh@gmail.com,I'd appreciate an answer to this email at some point.  Just so I can know someone actually read it.  I'm trying to do you a favor.  I'm a retired software engineer and system administer with years of experience in both the fishing industry and the internet.  

Your message boards are badly damaging your brand, and your business.  I logged in for the first time yesterday and posted some fly photos.  http://www.drakemag.com/message-boards/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=27166

The first response I got, from a username "tailchaser," was "fuck off and die."  It got worse from there.  I got curious.  I looked around. This is not only common behavior on the Drake Magazine boards--it is the norm.  Your website has apparently been high jacked by a group semi-sadistic internet trolls who seek to keep new visitors at bay.  They are giving you and your business a very bad name.

There is even a cover page at the Drake Magazine forum root saying "new users often get rough treatment here, get used it."  It's possible you aren't even aware of this situation. It's possible you are on some level but have deferred to a system administrator who told you he doesn't have time to police the boards.  There are ways to deal with this.  I administer several boards myself.

It is only a matter of time before your advertisers become aware the current Drake Magazine atmosphere.  At that point it is inevitable your business would be very badly damaged.  I hope you see the wisdom of my friendly warning.  I'm trying to be helpful.  Something needs to change. Badly and soon.   What is going on now, under the masthead of Drake Magazine, is disfunctional and unprofessional.   It is inspiring a lust for revenge in more than one user.  

How you deal with this email is in some ways not my concern.  But in other ways it very much is.  ,,2014-11-23 09:09:57

scott,baker-mcgarva,scott@anglerworks.com,Just wanted to say I thought Dana's Thompson river piece wasn't very good, and i made sure i told him too. Since my mug is all over it, I'm somehow dragged into it.

Dana is talking about shit that happened once, and he seems bitter that his river is over-run with young whipper-snappers catching all the fish. It reopened old woulds over something that happened ONCE, three years ago, between a few of the regulars, one old one, and a couple young ones who spend 1/2 the season there, which might be the under-lying issue to it..neither party were rookies.

anyway...

I sincerely enjoy the mag...just this piece had me chapped abit

peace out

Mike,Wells,mikewellsintoronto@icloud.com,Hey folks - got to ask all my life magazine subscriptions offered readers discounted rates off each issue.  I was about to sign up for a two year subscription but after doing very simple math your prices are only .56 cents off the regular rack rate.

What's the benefit of ever doing a subscription then?  What's to stop me from going to the local store and buying one-offs or even the other magazines over yours?

Also I don't see ANY offerings for Canadians.  I can't order from Canada.

Judy Lyke,Lyke,jcarrl@msn.com,Looks like my daughter in law and I had the same idea for a great Christmas gift for her husband (our son), Dr. Scott Lyke.  She ordered a two year gift subscription for him. We ordered a one year gift subscription for him. When two gift cards arrived at their home yesterday for Scott..one from her and one from my husband, Dayle, and me, we realized that we needed to contact you and see if we can extend his subscription by combining the two gift subscriptions and hopefully prevent him from getting two copies of the same issues.  Combining our two gift subscriptions  would give him a total of 3 years of The Drake Magazine.

Aaron,Marzec,aaron@upflies.com,Hello,

My name is Aaron Marzec, and I am the owner of Upper Peninsula Flies (UPFlies.com). The rod side of my company is called the "Pere Marquette Rod Company."

Over the last year, I have been working with a manufacturer designing a 10'6" 6/7wt switch rod for the Great Lake's Tributaries and smaller western steelhead rivers where it is a little tighter. You know--river where you would like to swing into a bucket or work a section of pocket water.

With a lot of the rods that I have used over the years and a lot of the feedback that I received from the community,  we have come to the conclusion that many of the switch rods on the market are too slow (leaning towards medium action).

I will get to the point:

I want to send you my production model 10'6" 6/7wt fast action high modulus IM12 switch rod for you to test, review and keep forever if you will put together a small little gear review in the magazine.

I look forward to hearing back from you,

Aaron Marzec

Mike,Bauman,mlbauman.308@gmail.com,Dear Drake,

Mark Menlove's article in the Fall 2014 issue, "A Fisherman's Monument", has some fine points & great photos, but is marred by blatant inaccuracies regarding the Big Wood & North Fork Big Lost Rivers.  Having fished both over Labor Day weekend, I feel compelled to share the truth with your readers.  The Big Wood has a lousy fish count & is a brushy nightmare.  Plus you'll likely have to fight the local Ketchum dandies for good water.  They have a nasty habit of throwing money or stock certificates in the water upstream to put down the trout in your spot.  
But it's good compared to the Big Lost.  What a poor excuse for a trout stream.  Instead of wealthy sports, you're up against bellicose cattle wading & wallowing in every fishy corner.  Navigating the banks is like walking through a cow pie mine field.  
By no means waste your time in these waters.  Head to the Middle Fork of the Salmon, or better yet, the Henry's Fork.  These are not the streams you're looking for.

Oxana ,Stetsenko ,ostetsenko@ucpfund.com,Dear Sir or Madame, 
For some reason I could not pay for subscription renewal in my old account “isherbovich”.
That’s why I  had to create a new account “ os@ucpfund.com “.  Now I cannot log into this account. 
System says that the account does not exist.
In this connection I have the following questions:
1.	Is it possible to transfer my new subscription to my first account “ischerbovich”?
2.	What is the last issue of my new subscription? Autumn 2017 or Winter 2018?

Best regards,

Gentlemen, my specialty is Tenkara, above is a quick reference.

I'm looking for a regular gig.

I've been to Japan and caught yamame, iwana and amigo on a single Tenkara pattern that I use at home everywhere I go. I've interviewed almost all of the big Japanese masters (schools of Tenkara) and come from a long history of fly fishing stream-river-lake-sea, particularly small stream fly fishing. I help start the first North American Loop Team. I am a bamboo rod maker. A rod builder.

I know my shit.

I have a few articles in Tenkara magazine, you can view my work in print there. I am sure someone in your office has it.

Here is a list of people I have Interviewed for Tenkara: Daniel Galhardo - Chris Stewart - Eiji Yamakawa - Yoshikazu Fujioka - Hisao Ishigaki - Masami Sakakibara - Masaki Wakaba - Go Ishii - John Vetterli - Uberto Kitsune Calligarich - Jason Klass - Jeff Hatton - John Gierach - Katsutoshi Amano - Yuzo Sebata - Keiichi Okushi - Dave Hughes - Thomas "TJ" Ferreira

I would bring to the Drake, a respectable view of Tenkara.

That would be cool.,6025416321,2015-01-15 22:44:24

Fred,Savage,fred.savage47@yahoo.com, I have fly fished most of my adult life, mainly for rainbow and brown trout. I occasionally pick up a fly fishing magazine, read a few articles, then throw it over to the side. I've even picked "The Drake" up a couple of times and quickly skimmed over it, then put it back on the shelf. I'm retired now, and have a little more time to sit down and read. Several days ago I was in a Barnes and Noble and picked up several books and magazines, then went over to the coffee bar, ordered a coffee, then sat down and began skimming through the literature. I quickly discarded all but one of the books, and all but one of the magazines. When I got to the Drake, I first noticed the price written on the cover page--"Five Bucks". Cheap for a quality magazine these days. Then I took the time to look carefully through the magazine. Wonderful photography, a multitude of short interesting stories---probably more true content than any other sports magazine I've every read. WOW!!!! From out of the blue your magazine caught me by surprise! You can bet I am a new subscriber!! I'm in the process of reading every single article, though I'm not much of a salt water bum. Thanks!!!  Great magazine!!

Stephen ,Bunai,fedmfeathers@aol.com,					Duck Pond Carp

Living on an island, one might think opportunities on the fly are limitless and last most of the calendar year but Long Island is not your typical Island. Stuck in the North East and much further than a   well executed double haul from the largest metropolitan area on this earth, opportunities exist but confronted by record cold winters, and struggling marine fisheries they are not what they once were.
	The striped bass, the bread and butter of our inshore fishery has never fully recovered to peak numbers. Just look at the almost non-existent "fall run" in the L.I. sound bass addicts have been faced with for too long now. Big bluefish, our North East equivalent to Jack Crevalle, can not be counted on to invade inshore waters with any regularity, due in large part to omega fish and others over harvesting millions of tons annually of bluefish candy also known as menhaden. 
	Weak fish made to order for the salty fly fishermen have been in a "down cycle" for so long it makes you wonder, is 30 years still a cycle? So most fly guys look forward to the cooler days of Autumn, ans the appearance of hit and run pelagics like False Albacore and Bonito.. But for all the excitement they create the run is short lived, lasting 6 to 8 weeks max. So I've often wondered whats an addicted fly angler to do? When the exodus of June leaves me facing the prospect of 3 months of extreme heat and extremely picky fishing until the arrival of Funny Fish.
	The answer to my fly fishing purgatory lied in a small murky local duck pond. Visited by so many, fished by so few! Driving by the pond often I had noticed the large dark objects laying still, pointing in every direction on the ponds surface. I knew full well they were Common Carp, but was warned many times "Don't waste your time, they won't hit anything, least of all a fly!" But faced with the frustration of a slow spring run, followed by a Summer of  doldrums I found myself at the edge of the pond, rod in hand and wearing a chest pack of Wooly Buggers, Bead Head Nymphs, and San Juan Worms. 
	Now success was slow in coming. After countless hours of casting to slowly cruising giant minnows, one decided to hit a small tan Crazy Charlie, but a combination of a late strip set, with a miniscule gap on the hook led to a missed opportunity but the sight of 3 foot wide boil emanating across the ponds once placid surface and I was convinced that I had to land one. On my way back to my jeep, I noticed  the sign tacked to a tree in plain sight for all to see, "Please don't feed bread to the water fowl," And thought it was funny that there were 10 or more people lined up against the railing doling out white bread eagerly awaiting the flocks of water fowl. 
	I eased in amongst the crowd for a better look, with the advantage of high sun on my back and a polarized pair of glasses on my nose my fishy senses told me something more was going on under the ponds murky surface. After a few minutes it all became clear to me, a handful of large dark objects swimming in random patterns around the duck flocks. I settled in once home and back at the tying bench, a liberal pinch of white EP, fibers, a brown sharpie marker, 6 ottwhite , thread stacked on a # 6 circle hook trimmed to shape and voila ! My bread fly was born! 
	The next day found me at the pond peering into the water for opportunistic swamp donkeys. The first fish appeared slowly swimming in an exaggerated 'S' motion mid water column in 4 feet of water. I dropped the fly in front of the fishes projected path. He continued to the fly, fins rolling in excitement but swam past my offering, then to my surprise did a 360 turn and inhaled it! I'm not sure who was more surprised, myself that it was so easy or the 18 pound carp that the innocent looking bread morsel bit back, or the ten or so bird feeders lined up and joined the peaceful afternoon when the water exploded with a couple beats of the fishes tail and the 6 wt reel screamed in anguish as the fish took off down the bank, the yellow fly line shooting across the water clothe lining dozens of quietly feeding water fowl. This sent the flock into a full flight panic! 
	No sooner than 40 yards of backing disappeared that I regained my composure, fighting the fish back to me I half expected a tap on the shoulder that would lead to a citation for 'disturbing the peace.' When peace was restored I slid my hand under the belly of the carp and lifted it out of the water to an applause from the group of bird feeding spectators, assembled for the free show. That afternoon proved to be my crash course in duck pond carping- The most important lesson learned, feed them what they're accustomed to.
	By all accounts Brown Gobys have not yet invaded Long Island waters. And crayfish, although I'm told they live here. After 40 years of fishing the island ponds, I've still never actually seen one! So its high carbs on the menu for these fish, not hard to believe looking at their waste lines, the fish are short and thick and pull hard. They show a preference for slow sinking bread and corn flies laced with a little scent applied to appeal to  their sensitive barbells. Craw scents, followed by anise  oil or vanilla will all garner some interest at times but even then, carp being the temperamental buggers that they are, there is no magic potion. I find myself always trying to mix it up. They are much smarter than our sweet water royalty bass and trout. 
	Smart enough that I believe they've adjusted their feed schedule to reap  the rewards. Manna from heaven falls heaviest on Sunday afternoon, when the church goers stop by after worship to offer up starchy snacks to the local water fowl. The large golden minnows are keyed in to these events and respond accordingly.But The benefits of the duck pond go far deeper than giving this fly fisher a summer killer eats and screaming drags. This little bath tub warm oasis has helped to bridge the gap between lots of time for fishing, but no time the Mrs. dilemma !
	You see, after 25 years of marriage our relationship has evolved to a symbiotic sort among other things. Mrs. Bunai loves to go to the pond on a nice clear summer day and watch the festivities, but despite my best efforts to get her to be my personal chummer, she wants no part of breaking town ordinance.354-13. Now out fitted with a good pair of polarized sunglasses, she's become quite the fish spotter pointing out 12 o' clock 30 feet, 3 o' clock 15 feet, with uncanny precision. This, in turn has lead to an answer to the often asked question "What am I supposed to do while you go fishing on that floating bath tub!To which I replied I am not sure but "How are you at poling a flats skiff?,631 512 5206,2015-01-28 20:11:37

Jordan,Cavanaugh,mrlinesides@yahoo.com,Hate to say this but again I have not received my latest edition of the magazine.  I had a problem last year, that I was not receiving multiple issues.  I had to wait for an additional mailing cycle twice last year, before the woman in Customer Service that I spoke to would send me my issues - almost 2 months late each time!.  This happened with multiple issues, multiple times!  I have not received the latest issue again, and I do not know why.  I have confirmed my letter carrier is not a fisherman so he is not stealing them, I have to believe it is with your mailroom/subscription department.  My friends all receive their editions and my local shop gets theirs and I see it also at Barnes and Noble too.  If I did not love the magazine I would just cancel my subscription, because this is getting absurd!  Please correct this problem and send me my latest issue.  I believe I signed up for a 3 year subscription, but if I have to buy the magazine to get the issues that defeats the theory of subscribing and costs me double!.  HELP!!!  I want my Drake issues to come in the mail like everyone else, on time, when they should, that is all I ask!  Is that too much to ask for :(,7147617625,2015-02-05 09:51:14

Jack & Barbra,Donachy,southjetty@hotmail.com,,,205 E Dimond Blvd,392,Anchorage,Alaska,99515,Hello Editors,
We wrote you a couple of years ago regarding your "Page Six Chicks" page. Again,  as life-members of TU and anglers who have worked with TU to raise awareness regarding the Neanderthal attitude many fly-fishermen have toward women, we wish The Drake would take note that the world is evolving around you. On the banner photos on your website, the eight photos feature a total of 13 men and 0 women. Your backward-thinking page 6 page is pure tokenism and nothing more. As we said a couple of years ago when we wrote, why not run a "Page 12 Blacks,"  or a "Page 7 Little People," or a "Page 9 LGBT?" We understand that because there are far more male fly anglers than female, there will be disparity in photos, authors and so forth. But 13 - 0? Last time we wrote, you guys were editorializing about your desire to see April Vokey in a mud wrestling match. Guys like you wonder why there aren't more women on the streams. Look in the mirror. Hopefully someone will read this to you.,book stores,2015-04-25 00:50:34

Al,Privette,alprivette@gmail.com,Get Kayaktive, LLC.,252-229-7040,909 Old Mill Road,,,North Carolina,28571,Hi!  I am a new subscriber, and just last month got my first magazine.  I was so excited that I took my new magazine with me on a business trip to Atlanta, and when I got home, I went to my computer bag only to discover  it was missing!  I searched and searched, but finally came to the conclusion that either it was stolen, or I had left it on a plane.  Either way, it is gone and I am very sad!!  I just want another copy please, and will pay for it if necessary ........ just tell me how.  I am new to the activity of fly-fishing but am so excited about about buying gear and reading all I can about it.  The Drake was a great resource for me, and I don't want to miss any issues!
Thanks very much for your consideration!!

Ben,Morin,morinobenito@gmail.com,,,,,,,,Hi,
In the context of your great Big Year Contest, I was wondering if you might have done some research on what might be the actual world record for the number of species caught in year on a fly?
From what I can gather, Steve Wozniak from California has caught 180 species in one year, which is probably the all tackle record, but that was not done with a fly rod. I could not find any reliable results for a potential fly fishing record.
Just wondering if you might have looked into this already.
Thank you very much!
Very sincerely,
Ben,Love you magazine,2015-05-13 18:48:44

I am moving my fiancee to Scottsdale, AZ from our apartment in SF, CA this upcoming week. I moved from the SF apt first, in February, so I'm very excited to have her finally come down. However, there was a MAJOR oversight this past weekend, which is while she was packing, she THREW AWAY my summer edition of Drake Magazine along with "all of the other mags," as she unknowingly grouped this sacred text with the gossip mags and discount flyers that flood our mailbox. I only found out about this when I asked if she saw The Drake, b/c my friend alerted me there's even a piece in this issue about Arizona Apache trout. I was hoping you'd be able to send me the summer issue (and update my address on file) to:

I then hired him to guided a group of my husbands friends, for a birthday surprise.  A day they still talk about!   He gave me his private number in CT.  I have tried a few times to contact him, but it keeps ringing.   I would love to contact him regarding guiding etc.  Please let me know if you can help.  Thanks.

Below is the query form as requested from the Web page for all article submissions. If any further information is needed, please do not hesitate and let me know what else i can provide. I think this will be a neat story...and something a little bit different. 

Best regards:
Tabitha Shaw

Brief Description of Story to be published:
A young man who began his journey at the age of 8, fishing for bluegill in a local pond…sores to the top of the rankings in the world of competitive fly fishing, only 2 years in the sport. Nick Bell who is currently sitting in First Place Individually in the Trout Legend Cup Race, has achieved numerous Victories. Currently he hosts seminars on Tactics, tricks and tips, and shares his story at many events including the “Oil Creek Classic” and the “TRG Club”. This story will showcase how hard work, determination to be the best angler, and vast experience  gets you to the top. Nick is very well known in the Eastern US, and a bit of a local celebrity in the Fly Fishing Realm. Nick is from Franklin, Pennsylvania and fishes Spring Creek (Bellefonte, pa) very often.
 
Why the readers will be interested:
This story is more than a glory tale. The article will depict the success of a man coming up in the world, taking every ounce of advice, learning what works and what doesn’t to catch the most fish.  Something the readers can take away from this story is to never give up….chase after those dreams, learn all you can and apply it in the most tactical way possible! Readers may also learn a thing or two from competitive angler secrets!
  
Why I am qualified to write the story:
I travel with Nick to Every Competition, I help him set up all events, I am also the team Administrator of Team Headwaters, 2015/
 
Photos: Will submit photos upon request.

Derek,Heinz,djhfishfinder@gmail.com,,4252461753,4317 SE Issaquah-Pine Lk. Rd. 303,,Sammamish,Washington,98075,Hello, I'm a regular reader and fan of The Drake. Of course I'm also a diehard fisherman.  

Recently I've made the decision to write about fishing:  the dream trips and the disaster trips, the new rivers, the relationships forms and occasionally tested, the natural beauty, etc.  I've written a dozen such memoirs/narratives, the most recent about witnessing a fisherman drown in front of his family on The Deschutes River.  They've all been very favorably reviewed by many fish slayers.

I work in school administration and taught high school English prior to that.  Now I hope to work exclusively in the fly fishing industry and specifically as a writer.  The decision was made to feed my soul....  Please tell me how/if I can begin that journey with The Drake.  I am happy to write a query letter if that's the necessary channel.  Or I can send a manuscript. 
 
I am very eager to hear back from you and desire to begin this next chapter with your fine publication.  

Best Regards,

Sorry I'm contacting you this way. I've called numerous times and haven't been able to reach you. My client, CrossCurrents Fly Shop, just handed me an invoice from June 26th, 2015, #3078 for $42. I'm trying to find out if this is a duplicate invoice or needs to be paid. We already received an invoice for June 26th for $42; however had a different invoice number. Are these duplicates? Does our account currently have a zero balance or is this an outstanding invoice.

jake,Howard,scswampduck@gmail.com,Saluda Valley Guides LLC ,8033122435,138 Cannondale rd,,Columbia,South Carolina,29212,I saw the article about the stripers in the Congaree River. If someone would like to do an article about the trout fishing in the Saluda River have them contact me. Take a look at my website saludavalleyguidesllc.weebly.com and my company Facebook to see what we have been doing down here. Even though we have had heavy flooding in the area I believe the fishery will hold strong and the trout and stripers will continue to thrive and grow bigger every year. I'm also on instagram as @scflyguide and @colafly803. 
Thanks

Andrzej,Andrzej,6rid0j9u@yahoo.com,Hwx7ATi6QZ,3m8dV8V03hfj,,,bmuLJLNeNWW,Mississippi,Gnedx6sEm,Ruth, some hints are: eat enough rohugage type foods, whole grains, beans, veg and fruit, that you get a satisfying daily bowel movement (when I was a kid the doctors always owuld ask if we were  regular' ); eat small portions, and don't go too long between snacks and meals, make whatever you can special and enjoyable about planning, shopping, preparing and eating your food. People don't really need to eat as much as they are eating nowadays in the industrialized countries. I am at a international scientific conference now in Ancient Olympia Greece about Agriculture, Nutrition and Health and (I am a writer, not a scientist) my recommendation to everyone is, become informed, the scientific evidence is clear, processed food and trans fats are harmful to our health.Since 1970 s the first studies were done, the evidence was overwhelming then and nothing has changed: among other things, the human being requires a particular ratio of lipids in the fuel it consumes to function properly. By introducing hydrogenated fats into the diet, food and oil manufacturers have worked, not a miracle for the consumer (say, lowered CVD or other health benefit) but have profited from the degredation of the people's health.Everyone whines about their medical bills, pharmaceutical co-payments, insurance, Obama,   few think about the middlemen who pervert the food and package it and ship it here and there and reap huge profits while obesity in the population increases obscenely.,hRTpdQ1cJT,2015-10-11 10:46:57

Jason,St. Clair,jmstclair2000@yahoo.com,,,2252 Washington Ave ,Apt 103,Silver Spring,Maryland,20910,Hi, I thought I had updated my Drake subscription address when I did my others, but since I haven't gotten any issues at my current address maybe I didn't.  I just filled out the address change form and didn't get an automated e-mail confirmation--  does your system do that?  If it's possible to set up, that would be great for subscribers.

My other question is what my first issue at my new address will be.  I figure I'm stuck buying back issues for the ones mailed to my old address (your magazine is too good), but will wait if I will need to order the winter 2015 issue too.

PRESS RELEASE

For Immediate Release - 11/17/2015

Gogal Publishing announces the release of Stream Map USA - Southeast Edition expanding Gogal's signature brand with complete stream map coverage of Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida.

Stream Map USA is a searchable, color coded river, lake and stream map displayed over GPS-enabled roadmaps, satellite images, and topographic maps.  Each edition features a built-in search function allowing users to easily find even the most obscure lakes and streams.  Users can search across the entire region or limit their search to a specific state or even an individual county.  Once a stream is located, a simple touch of the map adds a destination waypoint providing users with turn-by-turn driving directions right to that stream.

In the field, Stream Map USA is a complete handheld GPS with maps stored locally for use without phone service.   The user's location is displayed on the map and the map tracks them as they travel.  Along the way, users can capture additional waypoints with GPS accuracy to save any special locations they find.  Each waypoint can then be named and notes can be added.  Switching to the field compass displays the user's GPS coordinates, heading, altitude and speed of travel.    When a waypoint is selected as the "Target" destination, the compass even adds a direction of travel arrow pointing the way to that waypoint and counting down the distance.  This is ideal for storing fishing holes, campsites, tree stands, scenic locations, and just about anywhere a user may want to find again.

Traditional maps have always treated flowing water as simple blue lines making it difficult to quickly identify streams and almost impossible to follow their flow without careful study of the map's labels.  Stream Map USA takes a novel approach mapping each river, lake and stream in a unique color allowing users to quickly differentiate any water from its tributaries and follow any stream from headwaters to mouth.

As a planning and safety tool, Stream Map USA also includes access to current water conditions through the USGS.  Each stream gage is mapped and users simply tap the map gage to get reports on stream height, water flow, and other important factors updated every 15 minutes by USGS.

"We wanted to step away from traditional mapping and create a 21st century map of America's streams harnessing the power of digital mapping, GPS technology, and the smartphone," said author and company president, Mike Gogal.  "With the release of Stream Map USA, we think we've done just that!"

Three editions of Stream Map USA covering the Northeast, West Coast and Southeast are now available on the AppStore for the introductory price of $8.99 each.  A fourth edition,  Great Lakes is slated for release in late November and Android versions of the entire catalogue should be available on the Google Play Store in early 2016.

Parker,Tuley,parker.tuley@gmail.com,,970-217-8389,5435 Aberdeen Rd.,,Fairway,Kansas,66205,Hello-
I have been receiving the Drake via a subscription to my iPad and recently wanted to switch back to a paper subscription. I cannot determine if I am currently subscribed to receive paper copies of the Drake quarterly. Would it be possible to determine if my subscription is still in effect and if I am scheduled to receive paper copies of the Drake?
I was living in St. Louis MO until approx 4 months ago and am now living in Fairway KS if you need that information.
Thanks

I re-subscribed in July '15 (I forgot the term, but the PayPal receipt was for $70). I'm asking largely because the post office here in my part of Tucson isn't the most efficient outpost of the USPS, and it wouldn't be out of the realm of possibility for it to have been lost. 

And is almost always the case, the magazine will probably show up tomorrow after I've sent this message. Thanks, and have a wonderful New Year.,Subscriber,2015-12-29 01:50:53

By Chuck Christopher

Have you ever wanted to go fishing, but just couldn’t find anyone else to go with. For a long time, I had the same problem… I grew tired of hearing my friends say that they had no time to fish due to nagging wives, family and work obligations. I tried posting on the popular free classified websites that everyone seems to be using these days. The only problem was that most of the people who responded were creepy and wanted to do other things besides fishing. In my mind, I knew that there had to be lots of fishermen having the same problem I was… So I decided to create a website where fishermen could meet in their state across the USA for the sole purpose of going fishing. In August of 2015, I created the site:  FishingBuddyFinder.com. The site’s popularity continues to grow along with our database of fisherman. . Fishermen love the site because they can post their “Fishermen's Profile” and view others for only $25.00 a year. You will not find any garbage posted on FishingBuddyFinder.com like you find on most of the free sites because we review every post. It doesn't matter whether you're eighteen or eighty, just a beginner or an advanced angler, fish freshwater and/or saltwater, fish from the boat or shore... I invite you to drop a line and try your luck at catching a fishing buddy today at FishingBuddyFinder.com

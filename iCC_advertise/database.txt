charles,hall,charleswigginshall@gmail.com,Hello-

My name is Charles Hall, I am in the first stages of developing a vertical publisher online media display advertising program for a DC-based, e-commerce site dedicated to luxury/best brand apparel for sports and adventure enthusiasts. One of the titles we are interested in exploring is The Drake Magazine. 

Some basic client demographic info:
- Adults (52% M/ 48% Female)
- Median Age:  44
- Median Income:  $145,362
- Top Mgmt.  18%
- Prof/Managerial:  50%
- A County:  51%

At this stage what I need to compile are site traffic info, user site demographics (HHI, M/F) and non-negotiated display cpm rates so that we can plan for campaign launch, optimization and rollout efforts. 

Launch would be June/July, rollout is Aug/Sept/Oct and holiday period is Nov/Dec/Jan.

Please let me know if you need any additional information. Look forward to speaking with the appropriate contact person soon.

best,

cwh

A few friends in the industry mentioned that you'd be a good place to start to get my name out there.  I wanted to see what your rates & options are so I don't have to give ALL my money to Google....

Been living & working in Costa Rica for 9 years in the sport fishing industry, I just started my own travel agency on Jan 1st, 2014.  We offer fishing vacations (conventional & fly) all over Costa Rica, Panama, and Belize.  So far so good, but more is always better.

Tom ,Brodhead,tabrods@charter.net,Hi Tom,

I am working starting a business that sells fly lines aimed at the fiberglass fly rod owner. I'm recreating some of the old tapers used when glass was the dominant force in the market and updating them with newer materials. They will be American made and priced lower than current ridiculous prices for plastic coated string. I'm looking at mostly web advertising so if you could send me prices to advertise on the website it would be appreciated. Just for the fun of it what would ads run for the mag?

Thanks,

Tim,Evans,timevanswyo@gmail.com,2103802212,Evans Outdoors,5170 Webb Creek,,Casper,Wyoming,82604,Hello,

I would first like to say that I thoroughly enjoy your magazine.  It is the best fly fishing magazine out today.  My all time favorite piece is the Tippet from spring 2013 "The Way of the Spey".

Anyway, I am interested in advertising with your publication.  I am launching a new show on fly fishing.  It will follow myself and a few friends and fellow fisherman on our fishing adventures.  I am not planning on launching this show until later this year.  

I want to get an idea of the audience I could reach by using your magazine as an advertising platform and what cost that might be.  I imagine I would be looking for a 6 month run and most likely a half or quarter page advertisement.  

Can you please advise me on the size of your audience and the approximate cost of such an advertisement?  It would greatly be appreciated.

Beverly,Mosch,bevmosch@gmail.com,(203) 206-94,Woody Mosch Cabinetmakers,23 Wood Creek Road,,Bethlehem,Connecticut,06751,Hi,
I handle advertising for my husband's business, Woody Mosch Cabinetmakers (www.woodymosch.com).  He, BTW, is a fly fisherman and member of the Anglers Club of NY.  Wondering what your ad rates are for both print and online.  He is a master cabinetmaker & has made some fishing-related pieces of furniture that would make anglers drool.  Looking forward to hearing from you.

Thank you,
